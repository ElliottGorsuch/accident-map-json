        "Incident_Type": "ALASKA\nRIVER CROSSING",
        "Details_Factors": "Fatigue\nBrooks Range, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\nFour friends\u2014Dave, Edward, Greg, and Jill\u2014planned to attempt Mt. Itso (8,975\nfeet) in the Brooks Range. The group flew to the upper Jago River landing site and\ncrossed the river without incident. After five days of strenuous effort, via two dif-\nferent sides of the mountain, the group turned around on June 18, about 800 feet\nbelow the summit, in poor weather.\n     The retreat was exhausting, part of it spent post-holing to their thighs in soft\nlate-afternoon snow along a creek described by Greg as \u201cmuch swollen in volume\ndue to precipitation and the time of day.\u201d After a 16-hour day they reached camp,\nsoaked and exhausted.\n     They slept in late on the 19th and began hiking around noon toward the Jago\nRiver Valley, from which they planned to call for a flight out from the more acces-\nsible lower Jago River landing zone. In his account of the day, Greg noted that, \u201cThe\nmiddle fork of Trident Creek had been a pretty easy crossing two days ago, but was\nnow quite the raging stream. We crossed it OK without ropes, but Dave and I talked\nto each other afterward, noticing that Edward seemed rather tentative and shaky\nas he made his way across.\u201d\n     After the crossing, Edward led the way most of the day. At the final talus slope,\nGreg came upon Edward sprawled on his back on a large, flat rock. Greg asked if he\nwas OK. Edward replied, \u201cbarely,\u201d and explained that a rock had given way and he\u2019d\nfallen. Greg reported that he seemed fine after a few minutes. The group examined\nhis head for injuries and carried his pack across a few more yards of talus.\n     Dave told Greg he wanted to get the Jago River crossing done that evening,\n\u201cso we\u2019d have it over with.\u201d Edward concurred. Jill and Greg didn\u2019t object, although\nGreg mentioned that river levels were lower in the mornings.\n     At about 6 p.m., Edward spotted an 80-foot-wide, rapid-free stretch of river\n that looked promising. According to Greg, \u201cWe all agreed, either verbally or by lack\nof dissent, that this place seemed like our best bet.\u201d\n      They tied a 100-foot rope and 50-foot rope together with a double fisherman\u2019s\nknot. Greg put on his harness, tied into the end of the 50-foot rope, and set off. He\nreported, \u201cThere had been talk of the followers using a prusik knot, which would\nsecure them to the rope, but the double fisherman\u2019s knot in the middle made that\nimpossible. So the idea was to use a carabiner on a sling instead, which would pass\nover the knot but not connect the person to the rope firmly.\u201d\n      Using an ice axe for support, Greg successfully crossed the river, but the cur-\nrent forced him downstream with each step. The deepest part was about 2.5 feet,\nand he was forced to crouch to keep his stance, so the water was nearly to his\nwaist. When he reached the other side he moved upstream to secure the rope\ndirectly across the river from his partners. Greg placed a sling around a rock, con-\nnected his harness to the sling so he could use his body weight to keep it in place,\nthen attached the rope to his belay device.\n      Edward was ready to go first and clipped in to the main rope with a carabiner\non a sling. He set off at about 6:15 p.m. He buckled the chest and waist straps on\nhis frame pack for more load stability. His sleeping bag was attached to the outside\nbottom of his pack. Also using his ice axe for stability, Edward took a more direct\nroute than Greg had, as he was forced to follow the taut rope. When he reached\nthe deepest point, about two-thirds of the way across, he stopped and began to\nstruggle. Edward was in almost waist-deep, and most of his pack and the sleeping\nbag were soaked.\n      Greg remembered, \u201cAfter 30 seconds we were concerned for Edward. He was\nstill upright but did not seem to be able to stabilize himself, and he was clearly in\ntrouble. I was powerless to do anything and just sat there watching him, hoping he\nwould somehow start making progress. I don\u2019t know if giving him some slack would\nhave helped, but it didn\u2019t occur to me\u2014unconsciously, I may have thought that a\ntaut and stable rope would be the best solid anchor for him\u2026. He made no attempt\nto unbuckle his pack, and it may have been dragging him down.\n      \u201cThe next thing I recall is seeing Dave, on the opposite bank, walk over to his\nbig rock anchor and undo the coils holding the rope in place. I instantly grasped\nthat his idea was that Edward would then be caught in the flow, and my anchor\nwould then pendulum him over to my side of the river, where he would come\nashore. Freed up, he could also perhaps ditch his pack or swim ashore.\n      \u201cMy recollection is that when the rope went loose, Edward suddenly went\nfrom his semi-upright stance to face-down in the water, under his pack, and start-\ned floating downstream like a log. He stopped briefly when I felt his weight on the\nrope in my belay device, and I held him for a second. But then the rope went sud-\ndenly slack, and I knew immediately that his sling carabiner had gone off the end\nof the rope. Under the weight of his pack, he was now sailing down the river in the\ncurrent. I was shocked most by his lack of motion\u2014he was not swimming, thrash-\ning, or moving at all.\u201d\n      Dave ran along his side of the river and got downstream from Edward, swam\nout to him, and managed to pull his body to shore almost a mile below the cross-\ning site. Edward had been in the water approximately 10 minutes. Dave and Jill\nbegan CPR immediately and took turns trying to save Edward\u2019s life for two hours,\n until 8:30 p.m. Greg used a satellite phone to call pilot Kirk Sweetsir, who notified\ncounty authorities, who then arranged for a helicopter.\nANALYSIS\nSeveral factors contributed to this tragedy:\n     Group fatigue and possible injury during Edward\u2019s talus fall. There were indi-\ncations before the river crossing that Edward was not functioning either physically\nor mentally at his optimum. During the crossing, he moved very slowly, lengthen-\ning his exposure to the cold water and possible hypothermia.\n     Lack of preparation for rigorous Alaskan river crossings. While the group\nhad experience as climbers and mountaineers, they didn\u2019t know or use the best\nriver crossing techniques.\n     Desire by the group to \u201cget the crossing over with.\u201d Heuristics and poor group\ndecision-making appear to have played a significant part in the choice to cross the\nJago River immediately instead of waiting until morning. Edward and Dave drove\nthis decision, and Jill and Greg \u201cdidn\u2019t object.\u201d If they had re-evaluated the situ-\nation, the group may have changed where, when, or how they crossed the river.\n     Use of the rope. The group did not have a plan for how the rope would be used\nin case of an accident. Roped river crossings are an advanced technique, with the\npotential to increase hazards if not executed skillfully. The taut rope, which angled\nupstream during the second half of the crossing, may have made it more difficult\nfor Edward to make progress.\n     Failure to loosen the hip belt and sternum strap of the pack. The group had\nbriefly discussed the merits and demerits of unbuckling their backpacks, but de-\ncided to leave them buckled for greater load stability. Experts generally recom-\nmend that hip belts and sternum straps be unbuckled during river crossings, so\nthe pack can be jettisoned more easily in an emergency.

        "Incident_Type": "CREVASSE FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped\nHayes Range, Trident Glacier\nSarah Hart, 35, and I, 32, intended to climb the east ridge of 13,832-foot Mt. Hayes,\nthe tallest peak in the eastern Alaska Range, from the Trident Glacier. The Trident\nwas flat and windswept in April, and the snow surface was so hard that we didn\u2019t\neven leave footprints in the crust. We decided it would be fine to cross the glacier\nto the base of the ridge unroped.\n     I walked in front, wearing a harness, while Sarah walked behind me with the\nrope. It was Sarah\u2019s idea that whoever carried the rope should go second, in the\nunlikely event of a crevasse fall. I only made it a few hundred meters across the flat\nglacier from the tent before breaking through a hidden snow bridge and falling into\na crevasse. I think I fell as much as 60 feet.\n     I was not wearing a helmet (as I was not expecting to fall in a crevasse) and I\nwas knocked out in the fall. When I regained consciousness, Sarah was lowering\nme a rope. We were able to communicate, and she told me that she had a good\nanchor for me. Using a Petzl Tibloc and a prusik, I was able to climb out on my own.\n     We walked back to the tent and used a satellite phone to call our pilot for a\npickup. We were safely back to the highway in few hours.\nANALYSIS\nIf you fall in a crevasse unroped, you messed up. There are a lot of dangers that\nare inherent to climbing, but this isn\u2019t one of them. My accident boiled down to\ncomplacency\u2014I just thought that it would be fine. It wasn\u2019t, and my fall easily could\nhave been fatal or resulted in a life-changing injury. I got lucky.\n      Though I could see evidence in the distance of crevasses running perpen-\ndicular to our path, I was certain they were either closed or well bridged along\nour path. There was no indication of the crevasse on the snow surface where I\nfell in. I believe that the high winds that blow through the dry, cold Hayes Range\n                                                  created an ideal environment for thin,\n                                                  weak bridges that sag very little. (Co-\n                                                  lin Haley had a similar accident in the\n                                                  St. Elias Range, and his report in Ac-\n                                                  cidents 2014 has an excellent analysis\n                                                  and recommendations). In the future,\n                                                  particularly in dry climates, I will be\n                                                  far more careful.\n                                                       In the fall, my shoulder popped\n                                                  out of its socket but immediately went\n                                                  back in (an old injury, but very painful\n                                                  when it happens), and attempting to\n                                                  climb out, without assistance, would\nSarah Hart starting across the flat, windswept have been an ordeal, at best. Sarah\u2019s\nTrident Glacier. (The pair\u2019s base camp is visible decision to follow behind me with the\nto the right.) Her decision to carry the rope and\n                                                  rope\u2014one good decision in a sea of\ntrail behind her partner may have saved his life.\n                                                  bad ones\u2014may have saved my life.\nHowever, roping up would have been a far\nsafer practice. Seth Adams                             Sarah was able to assist me in\n                                                  passing the lip by lowering an end of\nthe rope and hauling. She was very pleased with the Petzl Micro Traxion for use\nas an autoblocking pulley. Given that I found my prusik to be time-consuming and\ninconvenient for climbing out of the crevasse, I believe I will now carry a Tibloc and\na Micro Traxion, or similar device, as my ascending and rescue kit, with the pos-\nsibility of improvising a prusik as a backup.\n      A note on partner rescue: I weigh nearly 100 pounds more than Sarah does.\nThough we didn\u2019t do any hauling to test this, I believe there is no way she would\nhave been able to haul me out on her own using a 3:1 mechanical advantage sys-\ntem. I believe the common practice of carrying two pulleys needs to be reassessed,\nsince in many situations more mechanical advantage will be required.\n      Going forward, I will be far more cautious in my approach to glacier travel.\nWhen arriving at a new area, I\u2019ll spend more time probing to learn about the snow-\npack and the bridges. Though our decision to travel unroped on the glacier was\ncontrary to well-accepted safe practices, I believe many people likely would have\nmade the same decision\u2014with the rationale that it would be \u201cfine.\u201d I urge everyone\nnot to be complacent with respect to such high-consequence decisions.

On\nMay 6 he moved from the 14,200-foot camp to high camp at 17,200 feet. All other\nparties attempting to move to high camp on this day turned around due to inclem-\nent weather.\n     On May 10, at 11:30 p.m., a call to the Talkeetna Ranger Station reported that\nmembers of a U.S. Coast Guard team had found a deceased individual next to the\nPark Service rescue cache at the 17,200-foot camp. This individual was later identi-\nfied as Callupan.

Moreover, the weather during this period was poor, with high\nwinds, cold, and snow. It was likely a combination of exhaustion, altitude sickness,\nand difficult weather conditions that caused him to fail to set up his tent, leaving\nhim susceptible to hypothermia.

Dickey and Mt. Bradley). Two climbers were present at the SOS and\nwaving their arms for help. The pilot also reported ski tracks coming out of ava-\nlanche debris above them and a possible (unconfirmed) third climber in the debris.\n     A plan was made to send two rangers with a helicopter and a backup team in a\nfixed-wing aircraft. At 6:30 p.m., chopper 0AE launched from Talkeetna with rang-\ners Tucker Chenoweth and Joseph McBrayer on board. The rangers were able to\nestablish communication with the party via a radio that was delivered to the scene.\nIt was reported back to the station that no one was missing and the two climbers\nhad called for help because they were unable to descend safely from their location.\n     The helicopter went to a staging site to offload gear and make room for the\nclimbers, who were picked up at 7:44 p.m. and flown to their campsite in the Ruth\nGorge.

The pa-\ntient was stable and non-critical but had frostbitten all 10 fingers while setting up\ncamp. Ranger Tucker Chenoweth, at 14,200 feet, consulted with Horst to facilitate\nbasic care for frostbite. The following morning, Chenoweth and VIPs (Volunteers-\nin-Parks) Frank Prestion and Andrea Tupy climbed up to 16,200 feet. There they\nmet the patient, who had descended with his own team from 17,200. Chenoweth\nlowered the patient down the fixed lines, while his team traveled down indepen-\ndently. At the bottom of the fixed lines, the patient, his team, and Chenoweth all\nroped together and descended to 14,200 feet and the NPS medical tent.\n    The patient\u2019s fingers were deemed to be unusable for his descent to base camp\nand a risk to himself and his team. The patient was flown from 14,200 camp by the\nNPS contract helicopter and released at base camp, and he flew out of the moun-\ntains via fixed-wing aircraft.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the pa-\ntient, a 26-year-old male of Japanese descent, had fallen ill approximately three\ndays prior, upon arrival at high camp. According to his teammate, his condition had\nworsened throughout his stay at that elevation. Nevertheless, the day before the\nranger patrol was contacted, the teammate had left the patient unattended in his\ntent while summiting Denali with another climbing party.\n     McBrayer and VIP Lance Taysom responded to the climber\u2019s tent and, follow-\ning a complete patient assessment, determined he was likely suffering from high\naltitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). The patient met Denali National Park\u2019s emer-\ngency evacuation criteria, and a helicopter evacuation was requested.\n     The NPS contract helicopter, 0AE, was already en route to the Alaska Range for\nwork projects, and this variable made for an efficient extrication of the critically ill\npatient.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped\nChugach State Park, Mt. Yukla\nOn January 18, 24-year-old Dasan Marshall fell to his death on the north face of\n7,535-foot Mt. Yukla. He was attempting a variation of the route No Call No Show\nwith 23-year-old Nikolai Windahl. (Editor\u2019s note: No Call No Show is a serious,\n ESSENTIALS\nHIGH ALTITUDE ILLNESS\nPREVENTION, ASSESSMENT, & TREATMENT\nBy Dave Weber\n\n\nHigh-altitude illness (HAI) occurs when climbers are exposed to the lower baro-\nmetric pressure associated with elevation gain, resulting in insufficient oxygen\navailable for absorption by the tissues of the body. When a climber is unable to\neffectively acclimate to a new altitude, signs and symptoms (S/S) of high-altitude\nillness can manifest. The effects can range from mild to life-threatening. Early rec-\nognition and treatment are essential to minimizing the severity of HAI. The follow-\ning recommendations are based on the Wilderness Medical Society\u2019s Consensus\nGuidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness.\n\nPREVENTION\nIn general, HAI initially affects climbers at elevations greater than 8,000 feet. When\ntraveling to these altitudes, it is recommended that climbers increase their sleep-\ning elevation by no more than 1,000 to 1,500 feet per day. If a route requires a larger\nelevation gain between camps, it is best to remain at one elevation for two or more\ndays and travel to higher altitudes on day trips (hence the popular adage of \u201cclimb\nhigh and sleep low\u201d). It is also best to incorporate a rest day, which includes light\nactivity, following three to four consecutive days of increases in sleeping elevation.\n     Under physician direction, the medication acetazolamide (Diamox) can aid in\nacclimatization. Climbers at altitude should avoid any products that depress their\ninnate respiratory drive, such as sedative medications and alcoholic beverages.\n\nASSESSMENT\nHAI is typically delineated into three categories: acute mountain sickness (AMS),\nhigh altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).\nAMS represents the mildest form of HAI, while HACE and HAPE are both severe\npresentations.\n     AMS occurs when non-acclimatized climbers ascend rapidly to altitude. HACE\nis severe AMC characterized by fluid accumulation (edema) within the brain, sec-\nondary to climbing at elevation. HAPE is also triggered by travel at high altitudes\nbut is caused by excessive fluid within the lungs.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness\nHeadache accompanied by at least one of the following:\n   \u2022 Nausea (vomiting possible)\n   \u2022 Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)\n   \u2022 Fatigue\n   \u2022 Anorexia (loss of appetite)\nHigh Altitude Cerebral Edema\n   \u2022 Ataxia (difficulties with gross motor movement, e.g. walking)\n     \u2022 Mental status changes (including disorientation, irritability, combativeness\n      and/or unresponsiveness)\n    \u2022 Headache and other AMS S/S possible\nHigh Altitude Pulmonary Edema\n    \u2022 Shortness of breath when resting\n    \u2022 Excessive fatigue\n    \u2022 Persistent cough (initially dry and becoming productive)\nNote: Pulse oximetry (SpO2) monitors can be useful for monitoring an individual\u2019s\noxygen saturation trend over time. However, no correlation has been found be-\ntween SpO2 values and a climber\u2019s susceptibility to HAI.\n\nFIELD TREATMENT\nAcute Mountain Sickness\nThe most prudent treatment is to stop ascending, allowing the body to acclimatize,\nuntil signs and symptoms resolve. Rest days should be active, while maintaining\nappropriate nutrition and hydration. In addition:\n     \u2022 Consider acetazolamide (Diamox)*\n     \u2022 Treat symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea) with appropriate medication\n     \u2022 Supplemental oxygen can be administered if available\n     \u2022 Descend if patient is unable to acclimate or if S/S of HACE/HAPE present\nHigh Altitude Cerebral Edema\nThe highest priority treatment is prompt descent until S/S resolve. In addition:\n     \u2022 Supplemental oxygen can be used if available\n     \u2022 Consider dexamethasone (Decadron)*\n     \u2022 Consider acetazolamide (Diamox)*\n     \u2022 Portable hyperbaric chamber can be used temporarily if descent isn\u2019t possible\nHigh Altitude Pulmonary Edema\nThe highest priority treatment is prompt descent until S/S resolve. In addition:\n     \u2022 Supplemental oxygen should be used if available\n     \u2022 Consider inhaled albuterol (Ventolin)* and nifedipine (Procardia)*\n     \u2022 Portable hyperbaric chamber can be used temporarily if descent isn\u2019t possible\n* Administration of any medications requires both wilderness medicine training\nand physician orders/protocols.\n     Note: HACE and HAPE can occur simultaneously and differential diagnosis can\nprove difficult. For this reason, some experts recommend initially treating severe\nHAI patients for both HACE and HAPE, until a diagnosis becomes clear.\n\nHOSPITAL TREATMENT\nTreatment of HAI in the clinical setting is similar to management in the field. Moun-\ntaineers suffering from the ill effects of altitude exposure often show improvement\nsimply with transport to a lower elevation. Severe HAI patients should be assessed\nand monitored for any prolonged neurological and/or respiratory aftereffects as-\nsociated with HACE/HAPE.\n      See the online version of this story (publications.americanalpineclub.org) for a\nlist of resources and a link to the Wilderness Medical Society guidelines.",

Shasta, Avalanche Gulch\u2013Casaval Ridge\nOn April 10 a male climber in his 20s attempted a solo ski ascent via Avalanche\nGulch and Casaval Ridge. The weather was clear and the conditions ideal for such\na trip. He started climbing at 4 a.m. and did not summit until 7 p.m. While descend-\ning, though it was still light out, he got disoriented. He had decided not to ski\u2014he\nlater said he couldn\u2019t get his skins off. He also mentioned that his GPS had stopped\nworking. He decided to start glissading with his skis on his pack, but headed down\nthe east side of the mountain. (Avalanche Gulch is on the south side.) While glis-\nsading, one of his skis fell off his pack. He was too tired to retrieve it and decided\nto leave his other ski too.\n     The climber ended up spending the night in an open bivy in the Mud Creek/\nKonwakiton Glacier area. He called 911 that night and also activated his SPOT de-\nvice. Lead climbing ranger Nick Meyers, alerted to the situation at 2 a.m., tried\nnumerous times to reach the climber without success. A plan was made to search\nfor the climber the next morning. Early on April 11, Meyers reached the climber by\nphone, and through conversation and the SPOT device\u2019s signal, Meyers confirmed\nhis location and talked him through walking over Sargents Ridge and down into\nthe Old Ski Bowl. Meanwhile, Meyers asked for a California Highway Patrol (CHP)\nhelicopter to fly over the area to confirm the climber\u2019s location and be available in\ncase of injury. CHP spotted him on top of Sargents Ridge and picked him up from\nthere. He suffered no injuries other than exhaustion and damaged pride\u2014and the\nloss of a sweet pair of skis.\n\nANALYSIS\n    The climber was equipped with dual alpine ice axes with leashes, a harness,\nand various other top-notch gear. He was unfamiliar with the route and overbur-\ndened with his equipment. While it\u2019s great to be prepared, there is a line between\nhaving enough equipment and too much unnecessary gear. Better research and\nplanning would have helped the climber pack the appropriate equipment for his\nadventure. Also, GPS units have limitations, including battery failure.

The climber agreed and\nquickly prepared to glissade. The slope the individual intended to glissade was a\nbit steeper than the route of ascent, and the snow was quite soft due to the hour\nof the day and warm, summer-like temperatures.\n     Shortly after the climber started his glissade, a point-release, loose-wet av-\nalanche was triggered. It gained speed and entrained a considerable amount of\nsnow and the climber. The avalanche grew to an estimated 150\u2013200 feet wide and\ntraveled close to 1,200 feet. The climber tried to use his axe to self-arrest, but was\n unable to stop. When the avalanche came to a rest, the climber managed to stay on\ntop of the debris, but he had been battered by debris within the slide and sustained\nwhat\u2014at the time\u2014were considered minor injuries. He was able to self-rescue by\ngingerly hiking 4,000 feet down and three miles to the Brewer Creek trailhead. A\nvisit to the hospital revealed two hairline femur fractures and a large contusion.\nANALYSIS\nSpring and early summer conditions on Mt. Shasta, while seemingly benign, can\npresent several dangerous factors. Cold nights create firm snow in the morning,\nwhich can lead to long falls should one slip and fail to self-arrest. On the other\nhand, warm nights and hot days can exacerbate rockfall and make for very soft\nsnow surfaces, resulting in loose-wet, point-release avalanches. Midafternoon sun\non warm easterly and southerly aspects presents the most favorable conditions for\nloose-wet snow instability. These slides start small but can quickly grow as they\nmove downhill. A skier, glissading climber, or rockfall can easily start a loose-wet\nslide and sweep a person into rocks, over a cliff, or into a crevasse.\n     This climber should be commended for his self-rescue. Mt. Shasta is in close\nproximity to urban areas, but climbers need to remember that timely rescue is not\nalways an option.

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience, Off Route\nSawtooth Range, Cleaver Peak\nOn March 21 the Mineral County Sheriff (Nevada) received a 911 call from Brandon\nReiff (33) of Reno, who reported that he had broken his leg in a fall near Matterhorn\nPeak (12,280 feet). His 911 call was transferred to the Mono County Sheriff, but the\ncall was dropped due to poor reception. Attempts to re-establish contact were\nunsuccessful, so his exact whereabouts were unknown.\n     Mono County SAR responded, along with a helicopter from the California High-\nway Patrol. Due to high winds, the helicopter had limited capability for searching\nnear the 12,000-foot peak, so a larger helicopter was requested. Just prior to dark,\nthe subject was spotted at approximately 10,000 feet on a steep slope below the\ncrest of ridgeline forming Cleaver Peak (11,760\u2019), two miles north of Matterhorn\nPeak. The helicopter tried numerous times to lower a medic but was unsuccessful\ndue to high winds, the steep slope, and darkness.\n     That evening Mono County SAR personnel began hiking to the subject\u2019s lo-\ncation. A larger helicopter and assistance from the Inyo County SAR team were\nrequested for the morning of March 22. While SAR personnel climbed to the vic-\ntim\u2019s location, a Chinook helicopter was able to lower a crewman. The climber was\nhoisted up to the helicopter, then flown to Bryant Field in Bridgeport. (Source:\nMono County SAR.)\n\nANALYSIS\nIn late winter or early spring, any route on Matterhorn Peak or Cleaver Peak is a\nmountaineering objective, involving a considerable amount of steep snow climb-\ning and exposed, steep, and possibly snow-covered rock. Although this climber\u2019s\nequipment included mountaineering boots, crampons, a climbing helmet, and an\nappropriate clothing system for winter mountaineering\u2014but no ice axe\u2014he did not\nhave technical mountaineering skills or experience.\n     According to the climber, he made the decision to attempt Matterhorn Peak\nlate the night before and did not leave the trailhead until after 8:30 a.m. He was\nunable to locate the trail toward the peak; instead, he chose to scramble and bush-\nwhack up a streambed toward the mountain. After realizing he had underestimat-\ned the approach to Matterhorn Peak, he decided to attempt Cleaver Peak instead,\nwithout foreknowledge of any route. He climbed the snow slope up to the ridgeline\nforming Cleaver Peak with crampons. Once reaching the steep rock walls on Cleav-\ner\u2019s northeast side, he continued upward but soon realized the terrain necessitated\nrock climbing equipment, and so he began downclimbing.\n                                                  While negotiating a steep section, the\n                                            climber decided to let go and drop a short dis-\n                                            tance to a ledge below. Upon impact with the\n                                            ledge, the climber broke his leg and went into\n                                            a free fall down rock cliffs and snow slopes,\n                                            eventually coming to a stop on a snowbank.\n                                            He placed a call to 911 and attempted to splint\n                                            his leg. The climber noted he\u2019d also dislocated\n                                            his left shoulder and broken multiple ribs; he\n                                            also had pain and swelling on the back of his\n                                            head and neck. Due to his injuries and the dif-\n                                            ficulty of rescue, the climber spent a full night\n                                            out in single-digit temperatures and was lucky\n                                            to survive without additional cold injuries.\n                                                 What can novice mountaineers take away\n                                            from this?\n                                                 Plan ahead.

As\nYOSAR mobilized to El Cap Meadow, a ranger at the base of Pine Line (a 5.7 crack\njust below the start of the Nose) indicated that the injured climber\u2019s partners were\nbelaying around the corner from the victim, anchored to the pine tree at the top of\nPine Line. The ranger also said that another team, which had been waiting to start\nthe Nose, was assisting the climbers and had fixed a line from the top of Pine Line\nto the ground.\n     One member of the assisting team was able to clip the injured climber into\ntheir system and rappel with the injured climber, who was ambulatory, down to\nthe base. Shortly after the injured climber had reached the ground, YOSAR arrived\non scene with a litter team. They loaded the injured climber into the litter and\nwheeled him out to El Cap Meadow, where the climber was transferred to a medi-\ncal helicopter.\n ANALYSIS\nThere were a couple of contributing factors in this incident. First, after completing\nPine Line, most parties will move the belay around a corner to the ledge beneath\nthe first pitch of the Nose before starting that route. This decreases the potential\nfor rope drag on the leader, and better communication can be maintained between\nbelayer and leader. The leader was leapfrogging two cams on the first pitch of the\nNose (5.10d or C1) when both pieces, for whatever reason, came out of the crack;\nno other gear was in position to protect the climber, and he fell to the ledge at the\nstart of the pitch. In this case, additional protection may not have prevented the\nledge fall, due to rope stretch. However, if you\u2019re going to leapfrog gear, it\u2019s a good\nidea to leave sufficient protection in place to prevent a dangerous fall. (Source: NPS\nranger Brandon Latham.)",

On the second pitch I got slightly off-route, committed to a difficult\nmove well above the last available gear, and then a handhold broke. My final piece\nof protection was good, but I was just too far above it. The protection may have\nhelped absorb my fall, but I still hit a ledge below, hard. The fall was roughly 25 feet\nin all.\n     The front and back of my helmet took a serious impact in the fall; it definitely\nsaved my head. Initially I felt dizzy and believed I had broken a rib and possibly my\ntailbone. My partner and I discussed calling for a rescue, but I felt I could get off\nthe climb under my own power and we self-rescued, with my partner controlling\nmy rappel. He helped me to the car and drove me to the hospital, where CT and\nMRI scans confirmed a minor concussion, three fractured vertebrae, and other\nspinal injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nWe were too eager to climb.

A member of the team of three was leading midway up the Changing Cor-\nners pitch, above Camp VI, when a piece of gear dropped and landed on a small\nledge, roughly 25 feet below Camp VI. In a quick conversation, Tyler Gordon, a\nmember of the team of three, decided to rappel to the gear and retrieve it. The\nteam witnessed Gordon lean back and then fall from the Camp VI ledge.

A team of rescu-\ners was flown to the top of El Cap, along with 2,400 feet of rope and equipment to\nrig two lines for accessing Camp V, which is roughly 1,000 feet below the rim.

To\nthe best of the team\u2019s knowledge, Gordon unclipped from his tie-in point at the\nanchor before falling from the Camp VI ledge. His belay device, a Grigri, was seen\nclipped to his harness and closed shut, so he either fell before attaching the device\nto the rope or assumed the device was rigged properly when it was not.\n     As climbers we often change our personal anchor or tie-in when switching\nlocations at ledges, rigging rappels, changing over from jugging to belaying, or\ntrying to clean up clusters at belays.

        "Details_Factors": "Darkness\nYosemite Valley, Washington Column\nOn October 30, at approximately 8:45 p.m., Yosemite Dispatch received a report\nthat a climber, Ethan Gillett, had fallen 100 to 200 feet from the South Face Route\n(V 5.8 C1) on Washington Column and landed on Dinner Ledge. Another climber, a\nWilderness First Responder, confirmed that Gillett was unresponsive, not breath-\ning, and pulseless and had sustained injuries not compatible with life. Based on\nthis report, park medical control concurred that Gillett was deceased and a recov-\nery operation was delayed until the next morning. The other climbers at Dinner\nLedge\u2014seven in all, including Gillett\u2019s partner, Joshua Schultz\u2014decided to rappel\noff that night, leaving behind fixed lines to Dinner Ledge. A small team of rescuers\nhiked to the base of the route to help them down to the valley floor.\n     The next morning the recovery team climbed to Dinner Ledge. Gillett lay\nabout 20 feet up and left of the main part of the ledge, in a group of large boulders\nnear the start of the route Southern Man. He was wearing a helmet and a rappel\nglove on his right hand. A Grigri was attached to the belay loop of his harness via a\nlocked auto-locking carabiner. There was no indication of incorrect rigging.\n     The previous day Schultz and Gillett had climbed the first three pitches of the\nSouth Face to Dinner Ledge. They bivouacked there and, according to Schultz,\nbegan climbing the remaining eight pitches to the summit the morning of the in-\ncident, leaving their bivy gear at Dinner Ledge. After topping out near sunset, they\nbegan rappelling the route, intending to retrieve their gear and continue to the\n base in the dark. This is a common strategy for parties not wanting to haul gear up\nthe route; it also avoids the slippery scramble with large packs down North Dome\nGully, the alternate descent from the summit.\n     Schultz was having problems with his headlamp so Gillett went first in order\nto find the rappel stations using his functioning headlamp. When they reached the\nanchor for pitch six they found fixed lines belonging to a party that was now biv-\nouacked on Dinner Ledge, two rappels below. Gillett yelled down to the climbers,\nasking for permission to use their fixed lines, and the climbers agreed. Gillett and\nSchultz coiled their ropes and began rappelling a fixed blue rope. Gillett went first\nto the pitch five anchor, followed by Schultz.\n     As Schultz arrived at the pitch five anchor, Gillett stated, \u201cAlright, I am going\nto rap,\u201d and he began rappelling another fixed blue rope. Shortly thereafter, Schultz\nheard him yell briefly, followed by a loud crash a couple of seconds later. Schultz\ncalled to Gillett. There was no response, but a voice on Dinner Ledge said, \u201cCPR.\u201d\nHe pulled up the blue line Gillett had rappelled and discovered that it was only a\n40-foot, unknotted tail strand of the same blue rope they had just used to rappel\npitch six; this rope had been tied off at the pitch five anchor, leaving the strand\nhanging below.\n     Schultz realized Gillett must have rappelled off the end of the rope. He found\nanother rope fixed at the same anchor, white in color, and asked the climbers on\nDinner Ledge if it reached them. They responded affirmatively, so he rappelled this\nline to the ledge.\nANALYSIS\nFixed lines are common on popular wall routes in Yosemite. They can make your\ndescent faster, easier, and even comforting, giving you a sense of being home be-\nfore you get there. But those factors also breed complacency, leading to shortcuts\nin procedure and loss of discipline. We don\u2019t know what went through Gillett\u2019s\nmind as he started his final rappel, but it\u2019s clear that he missed some steps\u2014steps\nthat were especially important in the dark. Had he noticed that the rope below him\nwas unusually lightweight, or asked the climbers on Dinner Ledge to confirm the\nrope reached them, or paused to check the rope below him as he rappelled, this\naccident might have been prevented.

The last thing the leader remembers is placing a\nmicro-cam and stepping into an aider to weight it. Speaking with other climbers at\nthe scene, it appears this top piece blew and the climber proceeded to pull at least\ntwo more pieces of protection before being caught by a number four Camalot. Af-\nter the fall, the belayer was able to lower the climber to a ledge and then descend\nto the injured leader to assist.\n     The placement of multiple questionable pieces of protection in a row was per-\nhaps the main contributing factor to this accident. While we don\u2019t know for sure if\nthe climber had been back-cleaning protection, it\u2019s a good idea to leave solid pro\nat regular intervals, especially on harder terrain or above ledges. In this accident,\nthe leader was starting off a large, tiered ledge system that he may have impacted\nduring the fall.\n     Whereas megaphone communications had led YOSAR to believe the climber\nhad not lost consciousness, adjacent climbers said in follow-up interviews that\nthe injured climber was going in and out of consciousness, and that the climber\u2019s\nhelmet was severely deformed. (See \u201cEssentials: Head Injuries\u201d in Accidents 2015 or\nat publications.americanalpineclub.org for important information about identify-\ning, assessing, and treating head injuries.) We are reminded of how helpful helmets\ncan be in preventing serious head trauma: According to medical personnel on the\nscene, it is very likely the patient\u2019s head injuries would have been much more sub-\nstantial had he not been wearing one.

At the time, the injured lead\nclimber was hanging unconscious 10 feet below Guano Ledge, after taking a lead\nfall of approximately 20 feet near the start of the fourth pitch.\n      YOSAR mobilized two teams: a climbing team to start ascending the route to\nGuano Ledge, and a top-down team prepared for a 1,200-foot lower with litter to\npackage the climber and continue to the ground. A group of six was inserted just\nbelow the summit of the west face at Dano Ledge (pitch eight); without a landing\nzone atop Leaning Tower, it was necessary to insert the team using short-haul\n shuttles. From there, a park ranger and litter were lowered to within 40 feet of the\nclimbers. The ranger tossed a beanbag-weighted pull cord to the climbers in order\nto be hauled into their position on this very overhanging wall.\n     The injured climber was packaged into the litter at 12:20 p.m., lowered to the\nground, and flown from the base of Leaning Tower to El Cap Meadow. The partner\nof the injured climber rappelled to the ground with the YOSAR climbing team, and\nthe YOSAR members still at the summit descended via the Leaning Tower Chimney.\n                                            A visit to the hospital revealed no major\n                                            injuries. The climber was released the\n                                            same day.\n                                             ANALYSIS\n                                             A follow-up interview was conducted\n                                             with the partner of the injured climber.\n                                             The two climbers were on their first\n                                             climbing trip in the Valley.

The climbers had spent\n                                             the night alongside a soloist and also\n                                             noticed a second soloist coming up the\n                                             pitch below Guano Ledge as they be-\n                                             gan climbing the second morning.

Cheyne Lempe               a right-facing corner, to access a thin\n                                             crack. The leader proceeded to aid up\nthe crack without leaving any gear for protection, as the climbers were concerned\nabout rope drag after the pendulum. As the leader stood in his aiders on a micro-\ncam, the belayer remembers hearing a \u201cpop\u201d and seeing the climber swing sideways,\nback around the corner, and fall below Guano Ledge.\n      Although it\u2019s counterintuitive, a swinging pendulum fall is often more dan-\ngerous than a vertically oriented leader fall, due to fall force and terrain to smash\ninto. When the micro-cam the leader was standing on pulled out, he was pulled\noff balance as he swung back left. A few right-facing corners created features to\nimpact during the swing, and he appeared to hit the back of his head during the\nfall, beneath the rim of his helmet.\n      The belayer noted that the climbers had been anxious to move quickly that\n morning because of the other parties on the wall, and that the leader was po-\ntentially moving faster than he would have otherwise. On popular walls like the\nwest face of Leaning Tower, the Nose of El Cap, and the south face of Washington\nColumn, you will often see multiple parties of different experience levels sharing\nbivies and belays. Sometimes it is important to move quickly past bottlenecks of\nclimbing parties, but other times it is better to slow down and let other teams to\npass. Conversely, if it looks like your team\u2019s progress is contributing to stress for\nanother climbing team, communicate with that team to make sure everyone can\nproceed safely.\n     The leader avoided clipping protection after the pendulum in order to avoid\nrope drag on the pitch. There are many locations where it may seem better to\n\u201cwalk\u201d cams after a pendulum in order to avoid creating a \u201cZ\u201d in the rope. Using\nlong runners can be effective in reducing rope drag in these situations. If there is\nno way to extend your placements for reduced drag, one could climb up, clipping\ngear along the way, then lower off solid protection to back-clean the problematic\nplacement(s).\n     The belayer also commented that the climbers may not have been bounce-\ntesting their placements regularly. While free climbing it is rare to test place-\nments beyond a quick tug; however, when aid climbing it\u2019s a good idea to test most\nplacements. Had this climber bounce-tested the micro-cam from below while still\nweighting his lower piece, he may have discovered the cam placement was not\nadequate before trusting it as his sole protection.

        "Incident_Type": "FALL ON ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Anchor Tether, Inexperience\nYosemite Valley, Half Dome\nAround sunset on November 7, Angela Uys (26) was at an anchor on Snake Dike\n(III 5.7), preparing to rappel. Her tether system was not effectively clipped to the\nanchor, and when she weighted the system it failed. She fell approximately 500\nfeet to her death.\n      At 9 that morning, Angela, Mason Kropp, and Samantha (Sam) Perry started up\nthe Mist Trail toward Snake Dike. They were behind schedule because Angela had\nnot arrived at their campsite in Yosemite Valley until 3 a.m., due to commitments in\nSan Francisco. When they reached the base of the route, around 11:30 a.m., another\nparty of three was climbing the first pitch.\n      At 1 p.m., after waiting 1.5 hours for the other party to clear, Mason began to\nlead the first pitch. Sam led the second, and Mason led the third. They were climb-\ning with a single 70m rope, with Mason and Sam on opposite ends. Angela was\nattached to the middle of the rope with a figure 8 on a bight, clipped to a locking\ncarabiner on her harness\u2019 belay loop.\n      For her anchoring system, Angela had girth-hitched a Metolius Personal An-\nchor System (PAS) to her belay loop. She had extended the free end of the PAS by\ngirth-hitching to it one end of a 44-inch Metolius Rabbit Runner (a runner with a\nsewn loop on each end). She clipped the free end of the runner to the anchors with\na locking carabiner and clipped the rope to the anchor as her backup. She reasoned\nthat this extended configuration would allow her to stay well below the anchor,\n thus providing more space for the leader and belayer.\n     The sun was setting behind Glacier Point as Mason finished leading the third\npitch. At that point they decided to rappel, given the late hour, the slow party\nahead of them, and the possibility of a difficult, icy descent. None of them had\nclimbed Snake Dike or descended Half Dome before.\n     After reaching the third-pitch anchors, Mason decided they should rappel\nfrom an alternate anchor 20 feet below and to climber\u2019s right of his location. The\nalternate anchor had rappel rings and was closer to the next anchor they would\nuse on their retreat. Mason asked Angela to climb to the alternate anchor, clip in,\nand then unclip from the rope so that he could belay Sam up to join her.\n     Mason remembers looking down and seeing that Angela had not clipped a loop\nof the PAS into the anchor using a locking carabiner, as he had expected. As he\nrecalls, she placed a locker\non the anchor, but from his\nposition it appeared she\nhad threaded the end of\nthe sling/PAS through the\nlocker and closed the loop\nby clipping it back to her\nharness. It did not look like\nshe had captured one of\nthe sewn loops of the PAS\non the anchor locker. As\nSam climbed toward An-\ngela\u2019s position, they heard\nher scream and watched\nas she tumbled down the\nrock face. They yelled for Half Dome from the southwest.

On the way down they saw that\na locker was still attached to one bolt of the anchor Angela was using. There was\nnothing else left at the anchor. In his haste to get to the ground, Mason rappelled\noff the end of the rope on his last rappel. He fell about 10 feet and twisted his ankle.\nHe found Angela below and climber\u2019s right of the base of the climb. He checked for\na pulse, but she was clearly dead.\nANALYSIS\nMason and Sam each had five to seven years of trad-climbing experience, but An-\ngela had limited outdoor experience, with only a few trad leads, and she was still\nlearning the techniques involved.\n     After her fall Angela\u2019s PAS/runner system was still girth-hitched to her har-\nness. The free end of the runner was loose with no carabiner clipped to it. Two\nlocking carabiners were clipped to her belay loop. One, unlocked, had probably\nbeen used to clip into the midpoint of the lead rope. The other was clipped through\nthe two loops of her PAS closest to her harness. The gate was open and the lock-\ning sleeve was screwed into the locked position, which prevented the gate from\nclosing.\n                                         At the anchor from which she fell, Angela at-\n                                   tempted to clip into only one bolt with a single\n                                   anchoring system before detaching herself from\n                                   the rope. A fundamental principle of anchoring is\n                                   redundancy. In this instance, having a separate\n                                   sling independently clipped between her harness\n                                   and a bolt would likely have prevented her death.\n                                   Angela had clipped in to the second- and third-\n                                   pitch anchor with her rope and the PAS/sling\n                                   combo, providing redundancy. Perhaps because\n                                   of haste, fatigue, or lack of training, she did not\n                                   choose to create a backup at this anchor. Angela\n                                   was new to multi-pitch climbing, and the team\u2019s\n                                   plan left her alone for the transition from being\n                                   clipped to the rope to being attached to the an-\n                                   chor. Her faulty anchoring system may have been\n                                   caught if one of the other climbers had been at\n                                   the same anchor.\n                                        Other factors may have contributed to the\n                                   accident, including lack of sleep and distraction.\nBroken 5/16-inch bolt from the Mason and Sam said Angela had taken many\nOwens River Gorge and remains of photos with her iPhone during the climb.

When\nSederstrom did not return from climbing that evening, his fianc\u00e9e drove to the\nLower Gorge parking lot, where she found his van and dog. Inyo Country Search\nand Rescue began an organized search in the morning. About an hour into the\nsearch, a family friend of Sederstrom\u2019s found his body at the base of the climb. Sed-\nerstrom was on the ground, with a stick clip attached to his harness and an eight-\nfoot loop of slack between the tie-in point on his harness and the Grigri attached\nto his belay loop. A quickdraw was on the rope within the loop, with a bolt hanger\n(missing its bolt) clipped to the other end of the quickdraw. The evidence suggests\nthat Sederstrom was using the stick clip to go bolt to bolt\u2014unclipping the bolt\nbelow as he went and using the Grigri to ascend the short loop of rope to the bolt\nabove him\u2014when the third bolt on the climb failed.

        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Test Hold\nSierra Nevada, Temple Crag\nOn the morning of September 1, we set off to climb the Surgicle, a beautiful yet\nobscure feature on the Temple Crag buttress. Peter (22) and I (27) were to climb\nthe East Face (II 5.7), while Gabe (27) and my twin brother Brian (27) were going to\nclimb the North Rib (II 5.8). We would meet at the top and then rappel the east face.\n    After the first two steep pitches, Peter and I pulled onto easier terrain. Just\nafter 3 p.m., I started up the fourth pitch, where the obvious line of the climb dis-\nappeared. I traversed left of the anchor and placed my first piece. I was just about\nto place my third piece when I decided to make one more move to an improved\nstance. I had both hands on a large block when it shifted. If I had held on, it would\nhave fallen with me. I let go and fell approximately 35 feet to the ledge I had just\ntraversed. The pieces held and the rope came tight. My right ankle was turned\ngrotesquely outward, and there was a terrible pain in my lower back.\n    Peter, a trained WFR, was able to reach me safely. I was not bleeding heavily,\n and after some rest the pain became manageable. Recognizing the risks of moving\na patient with a back injury, we chose to traverse back to our original anchor. There\nwe would wait for the other group.\n     Upon hearing echoed cries for help, Gabe and Brian decided to rappel into\na gully on their right. They left gear behind for each emergency rappel anchor,\nand after the first rappel they had to ascend their stuck rope to free it. Once they\nreached the ground, they quickly realized we were still up on our route. They tried\nto follow our line, but fatigue and a reduced rack created a dangerous situation.\nThey then tried a seemingly low-fifth-class scramble to the left. This resulted in\nanother retreat and a stuck and cut rope. Frustrated, they returned to the gully\nright of the North Rib. They gained as much elevation as they could before simul-\nclimbing some 4th class and finally roping up for one pitch of 5th class to the\ntop. There, they began rappelling the face. At about 7 p.m., Gabe and Brian made\ncontact with Peter. Once we were all together, we tied together our two ropes and\nlowered me two pitches to the ground in one go.\n     Gabe, also a trained WFR, and I sheltered under emergency blankets while\nBrian and Peter hiked back to camp; Peter planned to return with supplies and\nBrian to hike out for help. The next morning, a SAR team arrived by helicopter and\nthe first rescuers reached us just before 11 a.m. As a team of five, they executed a\nrescue over steep talus, with critical assistance from both Gabe and Peter. For over\nsix hours, the team lowered me to the point where I could load into a helicopter.\nI was flown to a hospital in Bishop just after sunset. Almost 30 hours after the fall,\nI was given treatment for a severely broken right ankle and a burst L2 vertebra.\nANALYSIS\n    Certainly, the traditional lessons associated with this fall are not lost on this\nclimber: the importance of testing blocks before pulling on them, and the necessity\nto properly evaluate and protect fall lines. However, on this day our biggest lessons\ncame in the form of communication\u2014or lack of communication\u2014between the two\nteams on the wall. The other team could hear our calls for help but could not un-\nderstand us, nor did they know where we were. If we had a better means of com-\nmunication or had better understood each other\u2019s climbing routes, they could have\nreached us much quicker instead of spending four hours trying alternate routes.\nThis wasted time might have had dire consequences if my injuries had been more\nserious.

I\nturned to see my partner on the snow below, partly suspended by the rope, which\nwas wrapped around the right leg.\n     I immediately escaped the belay, rapped down to my partner, freed the leg\nfrom the rope, and set up another anchor to get us down the approach slope (about\n100 feet of steep snow) to a wider snow platform where our packs were. My part-\nner said that near the top of the snow gully, a large snow mushroom had col-\nlapsed from underneath, which caused\nthe fall. The slide and fall distance likely\ntotaled more than 100 feet.\n     My partner was in pain but was\nable to walk slowly with assistance. Un-\nsure of spinal injury, we called for res-\ncue. A climber passed by the area and\nprovided us with additional help. About\nfive hours later, two park rangers ar-\nrived. Several more hours passed be-\nfore the rest of the rescue team arrived\nand set up a litter to lower my partner\ndown the talus field. Nine hours passed\nfrom our first call for rescue until my\npartner got airlifted. The injuries in-\ncluded concussion, sprains, fractures,\nspinal injury, lacerations, and abra-\nsions, but my partner was expected to\nmake a good recovery.\n\nANALYSIS\nTwo weeks later, I returned with an-\nother partner to recover the gear that\nwe had left behind.

Though I spent an\ninordinate amount of effort looking, even digging in the snow close to the rock, I\ncould not find any reliable protection. One possibility may have been a picket, but\nthis would be unusual gear to carry for a hard ice climb and for Rocky Mountain\nNational Park\u2019s winter snow conditions. Another possibility could have been pro-\ntection way off to the left, halfway up the slope.

Instead of going bolt to bolt to inspect the moves and\nthe fixed gear, I was focusing on an onsight attempt and only gave the fixed draws\na cursory inspection, because the clips were difficult.\n      Most of the danger from fixed draws comes from excessive grooving when\nthe carabiner gets worn down. However, carabiners that come in contact with the\nbolt hanger can get nicks, abrasions, and small, rough teeth that are hard to see\nwithout careful inspection. When these carabiners are then placed on the rope-\nreceiving end of the draw, such as for a replacement carabiner on a fixed draw,\nsuch burrs can knife the sheath. These can be very difficult to see, especially if you\nhang directly on the rope running through fixed draws when going bolt to bolt. If\nthe condition of the gear is unknown, it\u2019s a good idea to clip directly into the bolt\nhanger with an independent draw, then fully inspect the fixed draw\u2019s condition\nbefore committing to using it.

One client suc-\ncessfully climbed the route and was lowered. Another client did the climb and was\nalso lowered to the ground.

We got to the base around 10\n After climbing the west side of Redgarden Wall (top of image) and topping out on Lumpe Tower\nat sunset, two climbers who had never done the complex East Slabs descent got lost (red line) and\ncalled for a rescue at 11:30 p.m. The standard descent options (approximate) are in yellow.\n\na.m. There was a very inexperienced party starting the first pitch of an adjacent\nroute when we arrived. They were knocking down lots of rocks, so we waited for\nthem before starting up the West Chimney approach pitch. My partner led the first\npitch, and then a free soloist asked me if he could climb through, which I allowed.\nDue to all these delays, we were not both on the ledge from which the actual route\nstarts until sometime after noon.\n     I had climbed other 5.5 routes in Eldorado Canyon, but Swanson\u2019s Ar\u00eate felt\nsignificantly more difficult, which led to delays. We made it to the summit of Lumpe\nTower around 7 p.m. In late March the sun was just beginning to dip behind the\nmountains, and the impending darkness created a sense of urgency. We reached\na notch below the summit block and discussed our options. My partner had seen\nanother party get ropes stuck on the Dirty Deeds rappel route, the closest descent\npath, earlier in the day. Because we had left the car so early in the day, I had not\nbrought a headlamp, and we decided to avoid the Dirty Deeds rappel out of con-\ncern about getting a rope stuck with only one headlamp between us.\n     We decided to follow a mostly easy gully off the back of the peak. We assumed\nwe would find the standard East Slabs descent from Redgarden Wall, and that we\ncould belay each other if a downclimb looked questionable. (Editor\u2019s note: The East\nSlabs descent route is difficult to follow the first time one does it, even in daylight,\nand has extensive and exposed 3rd- and 4th-class downclimbing.) The gully took us\nto a clearing, and by this point it was night. We found cairns and continued to walk\ndownhill until we cliffed out. We walked back up to the clearing and assessed our\noptions. Two other directions cliffed out. The remaining side had a cairn that led\n us to a number of slings tied around a constriction, with rappel rings. We assumed\nthis was a proper descent and made the rappel.\n     The mystery rappel placed us into a fairly flat, heavily vegetated area with\nsteep walls on three sides. We explored this area in every direction and eventually\nskirted an exposed walkway to a similar but larger area. We continued downhill\nuntil finding extremely dense brush. In the dark of night, we could not tell if the\nbrush was hiding a cliff. After exhausting all other directions, we settled into an\nopen section, back uphill, and admitted that we were completely lost. We called\nfor a rescue sometime around 11:30 p.m., giving GPS coordinates from our phone.\n     The search and rescue team arrived impressively quickly, told us we were in a\n\u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d section of Eldorado, and guided us through the descent, which in-\nvolved some bushwhacking, a lower, a long rappel, more hiking, and a short rappel.\nANALYSIS\nThis incident was clearly the result of poor decision-making. First, I should not\nhave left my headlamp behind. While lack of light was never an issue (the moon was\nbright, and we had one headlamp and cell phone lights), the fact that I did not carry\nmy headlamp contributed to the decisions we made.\n     Second, when we were at the top of the second pitch, we realized we were\nbehind on time. At this point we should have considered calling it a day and de-\nscending.\n     We made our biggest mistake upon reaching the summit. The guidebook listed\nthree descent options, but made all of them sound tricky. We blindly followed the\npath of least resistance, assuming it would take us to the East Slabs.\n     We did do some things right. We both had down jackets and plenty of wa-\nter. We were not in imminent danger. We also brought walkie-talkies, which made\ncommunicating with SAR easy once they arrived in the area. We were able to con-\ntact SAR and send them our exact location because we had a cell phone with us.\n(Despite seeing our location on Google Maps, we could not glean any useful infor-\nmation to aid in our descent.) Many online critics have second-guessed our deci-\nsion to call SAR, but I still believe this was the right choice. I\u2019ve always read that\nthe best thing to do when you\u2019re lost in the backcountry is to stay put and wait for\nhelp. That\u2019s what we did.

The leader placed his first\npiece in a crack/flake about nine feet off the deck, then climbed up a couple of feet\nand began moving into the crack to the left (a move usually considered the crux of\nthe climb). Here the leader placed a second piece, a 0.75 Camalot, about four feet\nabove and three feet left of the first piece. About eight feet above the second piece,\nthe leader\u2019s foot popped and he fell. During the fall the leader became inverted and,\naccording to the belayer, struck headfirst on the corner of a flake toward the end\nof the fall. Both climbers were wearing helmets. The belayer noticed blood coming\n from the leader\u2019s head and called to him with no response.\n    The belayer lowered the inverted leader four feet to the ground, by which time\nhe was conscious and able to right himself and sit. The second (a physician\u2019s assis-\ntant) removed the leader\u2019s helmet and noticed a significant cut at the left temple.\nThe second began basic first aid, and once the leader was able to move, the party\nwent to the emergency department, where four stitches were placed. The leader\u2019s\nhelmet had significant damage, including a crack, a deep indentation, and discol-\noration throughout the left side.\nANALYSIS\nThe climbers felt there were two causes of the fall leading to the injury.

While normally living by the mantra of \u201cplace early and often,\u201d in this case the\nleader had climbed well above his last piece, putting him at risk of striking flakes\nnear the ground.\n     The secondary cause (also due to\nthe party taking the route for grant-\ned) was the position of the belayer,\nwho was standing approximately\neight feet from the wall and was not\ntethered in any way. The belayer\nweighed about 50 pounds less than\nleader, and when the fall occurred\nthe belayer was pulled into the wall\nand upward, adding probably eight\nto ten feet to the fall.

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience, Communication Issues\nPikes Peak\nOn August 22 a female climber (age 39) was injured while being lowered from the\nanchor after top-roping a trad climb. She was in a climbing party of five exploring\na granite crag near the Crags Trailhead. Just below the anchor, it was necessary to\nlower over a large overlap to reach the slab below. As she pushed off the lip, the\nclimber free-fell to the slab, approximately eight feet down, fracturing the calca-\nneus and talus bones in her heel and ankle. The climber and belayer (age 29) had\nmet through an online post and had not climbed together before the day of the\nincident. (Source: Mountain Project.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis incident was discussed at length on a Mountain Project forum. The parties\ninvolved disagreed about the causes and conclusions. The analysis below outlines\ngeneral actions that can be taken by climbers and belayers to avoid this type of\nincident.\n     In this particular incident, the source of slack in the system cannot be de-\ntermined definitively, and likely resulted from a combination of factors. Slabs and\nother rock features can create friction in the system that make it difficult to feel\nthe weight of the lowering climber (or can disguise the fact that the climber has\nunweighted the system). Before lowering over the lip in this incident, the climber\nexpressed that she hesitated, a pause that the belayer stated he did not feel and\nmay have caused slack to be added. While lowering, the rope can shift over fea-\ntures, suddenly creating slack. When lowering from a slab (little weight on the\nrope) to vertical or overhanging rock, some rope stretch should be anticipated,\nand a pendulum swing may also result. For all of these reasons, a belayer should\nanticipate sudden additional force while lowering over a roof, overlap, or corner,\n or anytime the climber is out of view. If the climber unweights the rope by standing\nor grabbing the rock, the belayer should take out any slack in the system and sit\nin the harness until the climber communicates that he or she is ready to continue\nlowering. This minimizes rope stretch once lowering recommences.\n     The climber should clearly and loudly communicate with the belayer anytime\nhe or she unweights the rope or needs to maneuver around an obstacle. Once the\nclimber is ready to resume lowering, a hard \u201ctake\u201d should be requested to eliminate\nany stretch or slack that could be introduced into the system. On lower-angle or\nvertical terrain, when the belayer is out of view, consider a rappel descent instead\nof lowering.\n     Prior to climbing, the belayer and climber should discuss the climb and the de-\nscent to understand the particular risks of the route and to communicate prefer-\nences. This is especially important when climbing with new partners or strangers.\n(Source: The Editors.)",

The leader and\nbelayer were not in visual contact, due to\nthe rounded, sloping terrain at the top\nof the route. The belayer suggested that\nhe \u201cjust climb it,\u201d so that they could get\ndown and eat lunch. I correctly inferred\nhis intention to be that she pull up the\nrope and give him a belay from the top\nof the route, followed by a short walk-off.\nThis, however, was not understood by the\nleader. The belayer took the leader off       A climber leads the route Left Handed Jew\nand called \u201coff belay.\u201d A moment later, we    at Turkey Perch. Dougald MacDonald\nheard a crashing sound and looked to see\n the climber rapidly tumbling down the wall. We shouted for the belayer to stop\nthe fall, and he managed to grab the rope bare-handed, arresting the climber 15\nfeet from the ground.\n     The belayer was unable to lower the climber further due to a very high amount\nof rope drag. I lowered my climber to the ground, climbed up to the injured climb-\ner, and pulled her down by body-weighting her harness.\n     The response from the climbers at the crag was composed and effective, with\napproximately a dozen climbers organizing to aid the victim, several with wilder-\nness first responder training. The climber was neurologically intact, denied im-\npacting her head (she was not wearing a helmet), and was found to have a small,\nbleeding puncture wound on her buttocks. She reported pain in the arm, back and\nthe sacrum. Though able to walk unassisted briefly, persistent lightheadedness re-\nsulted in the decision by local fire department personnel to evacuate by helicopter.\nThe injured climber was later diagnosed with a fractured sacrum. (Source: Mark\nWilliams, R.N.)\nANALYSIS\nThis incident could have been avoided easily by discussing the climb and descent\noptions and agreeing on a plan before the climber left the ground. When commu-\nnication is difficult, simple climbing commands and using each other\u2019s names will\nreduce confusion. Before lowering, ensure that you are on belay before removing\nyour direct connection to the anchors. Have your belayer pull out any slack in the\nsystem so it is obvious he or she is holding your weight. Friction in the system\nmight make it difficult to know that you are on belay, so you can control the de-\nscent by grabbing the rope that runs between the belayer and the anchors, and\nfeeding it through the anchors until the belay is visually confirmed.\n     In this incident, the belayer was able to arrest the fall by bare-handing the\nrope without burning his hands even slightly. I later seconded the route on their\nrope in order to clean their gear. I cleaned a total of 17 cams on a 70-foot route\nwith less than ideal use of extensions. The amount of rope drag was truly unusual\nfor such a short climb, but likely prevented a ground fall. (Sources: Mark Williams\nand the Editors.)",

Both climbers had multiple 14er summits; Crest-\none was Jennifer\u2019s 41st 14er. While ascending, they wore Micro Spikes and used ice\naxes, due to ice and snow on the route. During the descent, the snow appeared to\nbe soft enough to forgo the Micro spikes. Near 13,000 feet, Jennifer slipped on an\nicy patch while crossing a couloir. Unable to self-arrest, she fell approximately 150\nfeet, stopping in a snowmelt waterfall. She had to wait for her climbing partner to\nhelp her move or she might have fallen farther.\n     Adam used both his cell phone and SPOT device to request help, texting im-\nportant patient information, including that his partner was 10 weeks pregnant,\nlikely had multiple fractures (including rib fractures and a broken leg), was cold and\nwet, and was having difficulty breathing. Saguache County SAR (SAGSAR), Custer\nCounty SAR (CCSAR), and Western Mountain Rescue Team (WMRT) of Gunnison\nCounty responded to the incident.\n     A Blackhawk helicopter from the High Altitude Army Aviation Site (HAATS)\nwas in the area on another SAR mission on Blanca Peak. After completing that mis-\nsion and refueling, seven CCSAR climbers were transported to the Cottonwood\n drainage at approximately 6 p.m. The helicopter then transported five members\nof WMRT to the scene, and EagleMed Salida inserted two SAGSAR personnel, for\na total of 14 field personnel. Conditions in the couloir included wet rock, running\nwater, snow, and ice.\n      The patient was stabilized and then lowered in a Stokes litter, in difficult ter-\nrain and in darkness, to a landing zone in the Cottonwood Basin, from which she\nwas airlifted to Crestone at 1 a.m. She was transferred to the hospital for treatment\nof several serious injuries, including a closed pneumothorax (collapsed lung).\n      On Sunday afternoon, at 2 p.m., CCSAR was again activated, this time to as-\nsist Anika Jimenez (23), who also fell in the Red Gully on Crestone Peak and had an\nankle injury. With a splinted ankle, she was able to hike out to the South Colony\nLakes Trail, below Broken Hand Pass, where CCSAR members transferred her out\nof the basin via a Stokes litter. Earlier that morning, CCSAR members had encoun-\ntered Jimenez\u2019s party during the descent from the Staufer incident. They told the\nparty of the earlier incident and warned them of conditions in the couloir.\n      On July 24, less than two weeks later, Christopher Kiryluk (34) died from a\nfall in the Red Gully. Similar to the incidents on July 11 and 12, the climber was not\nwearing crampons or Micro Spikes, and he slipped and fell on the descent.\n      On August 14, Bruce Owen (age unknown) suffered a broken ankle from a slip\nand fall in the same descent route.

After clipping the first quickdraw (previously placed by her belayer, age 26),\nthe climber slipped before clipping the second draw. The belayer did not remem-\nber seeing the rope behind the climber\u2019s leg, but once tension came on the rope\nthe climber flipped upside-down, violently hit her head against the wall, and lost\nconsciousness. The belayer lowered her to the ground and called 911.

Within another 10 to 15 minutes, an additional paramedic and other res-\ncuers with medical and extrication resources joined the first responders. The pa-\ntient had an open skull fracture. She was loaded into a litter and evacuated along\n the steep, loose trail, requiring three separate belays. She was then transported\nto Summit Medical Center by ambulance and ultimately was flown to Denver by\na Flight for Life helicopter.\nANALYSIS\nThe primary cause of the injury was the climber allowing the rope to get behind\nher leg, which easily can flip a climber upside-down in a leader fall. It is important\nto keep the lead rope in front of your feet and legs whenever possible. While the\nclimber had three years of climbing experience, she was not an experienced lead\nclimber (fewer than 25 total leads).\n     The severity of the head injury likely would have been reduced if the climber\nhad been wearing a helmet. Both the climber and the more experienced belayer\ndid not regularly wear helmets while climbing, and the belayer stated that he un-\nderstood them only to be useful in protecting against rockfall.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\nI (32 at the time, with 20 years of experience) broke my ankle in a lead fall in the\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison as the moon rose on September 25. I had been a bit\ncavalier when Jack Cody (age 30) and I rappelled off the south rim at sunrise to\nclimb Astro Dog (V 5.11d) in a day. Jack and I had climbed enough routes in the Black\nthat we felt very comfortable on its committing walls, where the only way home is\nto climb out. Astro Dog was supposed to be the warm-up route on a four-day trip.\n     It was dark by the time I started pitch ten\u2014the crux. We knew we would be fin-\nishing by headlamp, but I\u2019d hoped to have daylight for onsighting the glass-smooth\nstem corner. In spite of the darkness, I was certain I could hike the slippery moves,\neven with a backpack and tagline.\n     The crux boulder problem starts off a small ledge. I placed a bomber yel-\nlow Alien at waist-height from the ledge. However, I couldn\u2019t find solid gear that\nwould keep me off the ledge if I fell. I placed a marginal brass nut in a shallow,\nflaring pin scar and pulled into a desperate layback. I was two inches from a\nfingerlock, with the brass nut at my waist, when I slipped. The nut popped, I fell\nabout six feet, and I clipped the ledge with my right foot as the rope came tight.\nI sat on the ledge and rubbed my ankle. I\u2019d shattered my talus bone and ripped\nsome cartilage, but I didn\u2019t know that yet. I convinced myself it was a sprain.\nWhile catching my breath, I noticed some handholds behind me that I hadn\u2019t seen\nbefore and decided to try again.\n     This time I did what I should have done the first time: I stood in a sling from\nthe yellow Alien at my waist and placed a micro-cam (number 00 C3 Camalot) that\nwould keep me off the ledge. With good preclipped gear, I stepped back down to\nthe ledge and fired the crux 30 feet to the top of the dihedral, where my ankle gave\nout for good. I was cross-stepping onto a slab when my foot turned into a noodle.\nNo matter how much I willed my right foot to take weight, it just flopped to the\nside. I was 10 feet above my last gear and realized how foolish it would be to con-\n tinue on one leg. I downclimbed and dropped onto the rope.\n     Jack took over the lead. I finished the climb (several more pitches) by using my\nknee and grabbing gear whenever possible. Prusiking would have been more dif-\nficult and time-consuming because of the zigzag character of the pitches. When\nJack finished the last pitch at 1 a.m., he tied off the rope and went to the truck\nparked nearby. He got jumars and aiders and lowered them down to me to spare\nme the effort of thrashing up a loose 5.9 chimney.\nANALYSIS\nIn retrospect, my overconfidence and hastiness were the main factors leading\nto the accident. I wish I\u2019d taken a few extra minutes to evaluate the crux before\nlaunching into it. There is a tendency to feel rushed when darkness falls. However,\nit was already dark and the weather was stable\u2014there was no real reason to rush.\nIf I\u2019d taken the extra time, I probably would have seen the proper sequence and\nmaybe not have fallen at all. Also, my pride clouded my judgment. If I had stood in\na sling and preplaced the micro-cam before the first try, I probably would not have\nhit the ledge.\n      We also made some good decisions that kept me safe overall: I picked an ex-\ntremely reliable partner (Jack is an AMGA certified rock guide and solid 5.12 climb-\ner); we had headlamps and plenty of clothing, food and water; and the forecast was\nideal. After the accident, we moved slowly and carefully, wary of our fatigue and\nthe fact that we were in a bad position if Jack got hurt. Thankfully, because of all\nthese good decisions, getting out with a broken ankle was more of a mini-adven-\nture than a rescue. (Source: Derek Franz.)",

There was a party\nabove us and at least another party within earshot on a nearby route. I was leading\nthe Pegmatite Traverse (5.9+, pitch six). I was eight to ten feet shy of the anchor\nwhen I took an unexpected fall. I fell approximately 20 feet, hit a slabby ledge,\nflipped upside-down, and continued falling another 30 to 40 feet until the rope\nwent taut. I had lost both my climbing shoes in the fall. I did a quick body scan and\nfound I had minor scrapes on my ankles and left shoulder, a mild headache, and\nstrong pain in my right ribs. I did not lose consciousness or feel lightheaded; my\nalertness was sufficient and I had no pain in my neck or back.\n     I began to yell to Daniel to let him know I was OK, but I did not hear a response.\nI tied a prusik around the rope, inserted the rope in my Grigri, and began to as-\ncend. I jugged up about 20 feet to a ledge where I found an old 1/4-inch bolt, and\nclipped in. I put on my approach shoes and tried again to establish communication\nwith Daniel, with no response. My ribs were really hurting, and with every exten-\nsion it felt like they were on fire. Just as I began to ascend toward a higher ledge, I\nnoticed movement in the rope and assumed Daniel was moving toward me.\n     I could see my gear at this point\u2014a 0.75 BD Camelot had popped (marginal\nplacement), but the rest of the gear had held. The failed piece had only added\nabout five to eight feet to my fall. The last piece of gear, a yellow Metolius TCU,\n was bomber, but I did not want both of us weighting the piece, so I waited at the\nledge for Daniel. He ascended to a big ledge, built an anchor, and lowered to me.\nWe decided that we needed to bail, as I had lost my climbing shoes and was wor-\nried that I\u2019d fractured my ribs. We proceeded to rappel the Cruise route, doing a\ntotal of five rappels.\nA climber leads the infamous Pegmatite Traverse on the Scenic Cruise. Jediah Porter\n     We ended up losing a few cams, nuts, and webbing, but overall we got down\nquickly and efficiently. I ended up with a several muscle tears, a mild concussion,\nand bruised ribs, but no fractures or lasting injuries. My new Black Diamond Va-\npor helmet took the majority of the blow, with an indentation the size of a softball\nabout 3/8-inch deep in the right rear and bottom of the helmet. I\u2019m lucky I was\nwearing this new helmet, as my old-school suspension helmet does not cover the\nfull back of my head.\nANALYSIS\nAfter debriefing the incident, I discovered that Daniel had clearly heard the com-\nmand, \u201cDaniel, off belay.\u201d Whether there was another climber named Daniel in a\nneighboring party or he had just misunderstood a nearby \u201coff belay\u201d command, he\nbelieved it was me who had shouted and took me off belay. I fell shortly afterward.\n     I had experienced something similar while belaying on the previous pitch,\nhearing some faint command, but I decided to keep the belay on, thinking that I\nwould remove it once the rope was being pulled in rapidly, indicating Daniel was\npreparing to belay me. About five minutes later, I heard a clear, \u201cChas, off belay,\u201d\nconfirming that the original, faint command had not been from Daniel. The brain\nunquestionably hears what it expects to hear.\n     In such a situation, when there is environmental noise, the climber is out of\nsight of the belayer, or other climbers are nearby, using names with shouted belay\ncommands is essential, as is waiting for confirmation before taking a climber off\nbelay or unclipping from an anchor. When communication is completely lost, the\n belayer should wait until all slack has been pulled up before taking the leader off\nbelay. (Source: Chas Robles.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Unable to Clip Anchors, Inadequate Belay\nRed River Gorge, Drive-By Crag\nDuring the early afternoon on October 17, some friends and I were climbing at\nDrive-By Crag. My friends didn\u2019t have much outdoor climbing experience. Over a\ncouple of days, I had been watching Jake belay his partner, and I felt confident that\nhe paid attention and was managing the rope appropriately.\n     I had attempted to lead Breakfast Burrito (5.10d) on an earlier visit. With this\nknowledge, I made it past my original high point, clipped the last draw before the\nchains, and shook out before finishing. I couldn\u2019t get into a good position to clip the\nchains, and I spent a fairly long time on a somewhat bad hold and began to tire. I\nwas about four feet from the chains and began to evaluate whether I should try to\nclip or if I should take the fall. I opted for the fall, yelled \u201cFalling!\u201d and making sure\nmy feet were clear from the rope.\n     Instead of falling cleanly, I slammed into the rock knee-first, fracturing my left\nkneecap. I was lowered to the ground, where climbers assisted me and an ER nurse\nmonitored my condition. I was carried out to our vehicle and driven to the ER in\nIrvine. A few days later, I saw an orthopedic surgeon who decided on a surgery that\nwould repair my patellar tendon and remove bone fragments.\n\nANALYSIS\nAccording to the others, Jake took in slack and braced himself for a hard catch.\nHe is about 45 pounds heavier than me, and he said he never left the ground while\ncatching my fall. If Jake had adequate slack in the system, or had jumped into the\nfall, my injury may have been avoided. I spoke with him after the accident, and he\nnoted that he was unfamiliar with the concept of a \u201csoft catch.\u201d He stated that he\nthought the belayer was automatically pulled into the air, because whenever he\n falls on lead his partner gets pulled up. Additionally, when he belayed his partner,\nshe would yell at him to keep the rope tight. I realize now that when I was watching\nJake to evaluate his belaying abilities, I never watched him catch a fall. Whenever\nhe was lead belaying on our trip, everyone was climbing easier climbs well below\ntheir abilities. I shouldn\u2019t have made assumptions about what my partner knew and\ndidn\u2019t know. (Source: Grant Warman.)\n\n     Editor\u2019s note: Accidents 2015 reported a similar incident in Colorado, also re-\nsulting in a fractured patella. The appropriate amount of slack in the belay system\nvaries with the climb\u2014too little and a falling climber can be pulled hard into the rock;\ntoo much and the climber might fall too far and hit a ledge or other obstacle. As a gen-\neral rule, when sport climbing, it\u2019s appropriate for the belayer to maintain a small arc\nof slack in the rope and allow his or her body to move and absorb some of the impact\nof the fall. See \u201cKnow the Ropes: Belaying\u201d in this edition for more on this subject.",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate\nEquipment\nGlacier National Park, Lithoid Cusp\nOn June 27, experienced mountaineers\nJack Beard (60) and David Steele (27) at-\ntempted a new route to the Lithoid Cusp,\na dramatic spire atop the large east-\nfacing wall between Ipasha Peak and\nMt. Merritt. Their route involved much\nscrambling to reach a steep snow couloir\nthat led another 800 feet to the ridgeline.\nThe two continued unroped up the snow,\nusing ice axes and crampons. At 11:30\na.m., about halfway up the couloir, Beard\nslipped in the soft snow and slid to the\nbottom of the couloir, continuing over\nrocks and a cascade of snowmelt until he\ncame to a stop on a small outcropping af-\nter sliding about 600 feet.\n     Steele climbed down to his partner,\nwho had fractures in his ribs, spine, and\nright forearm, as well as a concussion. He\nbuilt a platform where Beard could rest,       The red line shows a new route attempted\nanchored him, marked the area with a           by two climbers in Glacier National Park.\nhigh-visibility yellow tent, and prepared      (1) Site of the fall.

At 5:45 p.m. he found a hiker with an InReach satel-\nlite communication device who was able to send a message requesting help. Steele\narranged to meet a ranger who would hike in his direction, and they connected at\n8:15 p.m. Rangers called for a helicopter rescue. A Two Bear Air Rescue helicopter\nlowered a crew member to Beard\u2019s ledge, picked him up, and transported him to\nthe valley and an ambulance.\nANALYSIS\nBy email, Steele described the climbers\u2019 decision-making before and during this\nincident: \u201cIn the wake of the accident, both Jack and I spent a bunch of time talk-\ning and considering what we could have done differently. The trip placed diverse\nneeds on our gear and ourselves: overnight gear, a complete alpine rack, two\nropes, food and fuel, plus snow climbing equipment. We went about as light as we\nfelt comfortable, which meant crampons and one ice tool each. We agree that two\ntools would have been more secure and could have prevented Jack\u2019s slip. His ice\ntool was especially compact\u2014it worked well for piton use, but that meant it wasn\u2019t\nsuited to self arrest. An axe with a more alpine-style pick and longer handle would\nhave been a better choice.\n     \u201cUnseasonably hot weather at the time of the accident meant that the snow\nsurface wasn\u2019t even close to refreezing at night; it\u2019s unlikely that an earlier start\nwould have yielded more consolidated snow. Protection in the rock along the snow\ncouloir was poor at best, and we elected not to carry a stack of pickets to make\nrunning protection. Because we couldn\u2019t protect the climb, our opinion was that\nroping together just endangered both climbers. We elected to solo both the rock\nand the snow based on our comfort levels.\n     \u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Jack is back out in the mountains and we\u2019re still\nclimbing together.\u201d (Sources: David Steele and Jack Beard.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nRed Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Dark Shadows\nOn May 6, two teams (Mike and Keith, Chris and Jeff, all experienced climbers) did\nthe full Dark Shadows (5.8, 10 pitches). Mike and Keith topped out about 5 p.m.,\nwith the second party trailing 15 to 30 minutes behind. We called home to report\nall was well, snapped some pics, and scouted the route down. Around 5:45 p.m. we\nstarted wondering what was taking our second party so long. We yelled for them\nand got nothing but echo and wind noise. At 6 p.m. we rigged a rope off a big pine\ntree to lower down the route and see about Chris and Jeff. As we extended over the\nedge, we heard calls for help. We scrambled back up, cleaned our gear, and rapped\noff the tree.\n     With a 70-meter rope, we were unable to reach Jeff, who had fallen in the middle\nof the ninth pitch while leading. We built an interim anchor and Mike rapped down\nto Jeff. He was conscious, standing on a slopping ledge, and had secured himself and\nrigged a sling for his right arm. He knew his elbow and some ribs were broken. We\n later learned he had been unconscious and had a broken scapula and cracked ver-\ntebrae. (All the climbers were wearing helmets.) He was in a lot of pain and moaned\nevery time he took a deep breath, which we attributed to the broken ribs.\n     Before falling, Jeff reported, he had decided he did not like a certain nut place-\nment and had moved up a bit to find better pro. When he fell, the nut popped and\nhe went 20 feet to the ledge.\n     Communication was a problem, with Keith above Mike and Jeff, and Chris be-\nlow. With much difficulty, Mike was able to ask Chris to untie from his end of their\n70-meter half ropes. With even more difficulty communicating, we sent the ropes\nup for Keith to rig a rappel. This would get us all to Chris\u2019 belay stance in one rap-\npel. We lowered Jeff to Chris and then joined them.\n     Led by Jeff\u2019s feeling that he could endure the pain, we decided to continue to\nself-rescue, leaving various pieces of gear until we got to the bolted anchors on the\nlower pitches. Jeff preferred controlling his own descent on rappel. He was in a lot\nof pain, but otherwise able to evaluate and communicate as we rigged his raps. We\nsent one party down for a fireman\u2019s belay and then Jeff would cast off second. (Edi-\ntor\u2019s note: In the \u201cfireman\u2019s belay,\u201d a climber below the rappel can control the speed of\nthe rappeller\u2019s descent by adding tension to the ropes, making them more resistant to\npassing through the rappel device.)\n     Darkness arrived at the top of pitch five, and although we all had headlamps\nit became harder to find the fixed anchors. We were able to rap to the top of pitch\ntwo before the 70-meter half ropes got stuck in the fixed anchors on top of station\nfour. We decided to continue with our remaining 70-meter rope, finally reaching\nthe ground at 1 a.m. We hiked approximately three miles to the car and drove to the\nhospital in Las Vegas. To our surprise, Jeff was released later the same day.\nANALYSIS\nWe needed a better communication plan. In Red Rock climbers are often out of\nsight of the belayer, and voice communication is often difficult to impossible. We\nhad worked out a series of rope tugs to communicate, but backup radios would\nhave been wise.\n     Our decision to self-rescue, based on how we assessed Jeff\u2019s condition, was\nthe right one. Some members of our team had wilderness medical training, and we\nall had self-rescue skills, although some not recently practiced. We made several\ndecisions earlier in the day that played out favorably. We planned to stay in reason-\nable proximity of each other, let others pass if needed (one group did), and when\none team reached the top we would wait for the second team. These decisions\nenabled us to get off the mountain relatively efficiently. (Source: Mike Harris.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Anchor\nRed Rock National Conservation Area, Oak Creek Canyon\nOn December 26, three climbers finished the classic three-pitch route Johnny Ve-\ngas (5.7) in Red Rock\u2019s Oak Creek Canyon. The three stopped for a brief lunch at\nabout 11 a.m. on the terrace at the top of Johnny Vegas to consider whether they\nshould continue up Solar Slab or rappel to the ground. Because of the cold and\nwindy conditions, they decided to rappel the Solar Slab Gully instead of climb-\ning any higher. The two females in the party made the first rappel from a less-\n commonly used bolted anchor to safely reach an anchor on a large, bushy ledge.\nAs the third member rappelled to join them, he fell approximately 100 feet, land-\ning on the ledge where they were waiting. His partners called for help with a cell\nphone. Despite efforts to revive their fallen partner, he was deceased when LVMPD\nSearch and Rescue (SAR) personnel arrived. The two uninjured climbers were as-\nsisted down the two remaining rappels by SAR.\nANALYSIS\nIt is difficult to definitively determine the cause of the victim\u2019s fall. There was no\nevidence of a failure in the anchor or a piece of personal equipment. The distance\nfrom the rappel anchor to the ledge below is greater than 100 feet, and their dy-\nnamic lead rope was measured to be 200 feet in length. The victim was carrying a\n6mm \u201cpull cord,\u201d sometimes used by climbers to retrieve a lead rope from below.\nStrangely, the pull cord and the primary rope were not connected.\n      It is believed the victim initially tied the lead rope to the anchor and his part-\nners individually rappelled on this single strand to the ledge. He then likely rear-\nranged the rappel setup to include the pull cord, so that he could retrieve the\nmain rope after completing the rappel. Because the two-bolt anchor and chains\nremained intact but the ropes were not connected, it seems that when he weight-\ned the lead rope it was not supported by the anchor and allowed him to fall to the\nledge below.\n      Upon inspection, the lead rope and pull cord had no damage. The lead rope\nhad no knots or hitches. The pull cord had a figure 8 on a bight at one end that was\nclipped into a closed and locked screw-gate carabiner. The climber\u2019s partners re-\nport that when he struck the ledge the lead rope was threaded through his rappel\ndevice, approximately 15 feet from the end that had been secured to the anchor,\nbut they disconnected him to facilitate CPR.\n      The evidence suggests he attempted to set up a \u201cbiner block\u201d rappel anchor,\nthreading the lead rope through the anchor bolts and then tying it to the carabiner\nclipped to the pull cord. He likely either failed to connect the two ropes, tied the\nlead rope to the carabiner improperly, or tied the wrong knot (e.g., a Munter hitch\ninstead of a clove hitch. See page 39 for a report of a similar rappelling accident\nand an illustration of a \u201cbiner block\u201d rappel anchor.) (Source: Las Vegas Metropolitan\nPolice Department Search and Rescue.)\n\n     Editor\u2019s note: Another Red Rock rappelling fatality occurred in March, when\nTodd Jenkins, 41, fell to the ground in Black Velvet Canyon. The experienced climber\nhad completed a sport route that was too long for lowering. He went off-belay and\nthreaded the rope at the anchor, intending to rappel once to a midway anchor and\nthen make a second rappel to the ground. However, the rope strands for his first rap-\npel apparently were uneven in length.\n     As he was cleaning quickdraws en route to the midway anchor, he did not notice\nthe shorter rope end pass through his rappel device, causing him to fall to the ground.\nGreater care with ensuring the rope lengths were even or tying stopper knots in the\nends likely could have prevented this tragic accident.",

Adams\nAt 5 a.m. on February 15, Kate Matrosova, 32, of New York City, was dropped off at\nthe Appalachia parking lot by her husband. She planned a one-day winter traverse\nof the northern Presidential Range, a technically moderate mountaineering objec-\ntive that often has severe weather. The Mount Washington Observatory, ten miles\nsouth of Matrosova\u2019s starting point, called for gusts up to 125 mph and wind-chill\nvalues of -70\u00b0F. Matrosova made her way up the Valley Way trail and began an as-\ncent of Mt. Adams, a smaller but exposed peak.\n     It appears Matrosova was beaten back from the 5,774-foot summit by the ex-\ntremely high winds. She made her way back down the eastern side of Adams, where\nshe reached the col between Adams and Mt. Madison, a half-mile above treeline.\nThere is an Appalachian Mountain Club hut in this col, but it is closed for winter\nand offers no shelter. At around 3:30 p.m., Matrosova turned on her SPOT emer-\ngency locater beacon, initiating a search effort. Several New Hampshire Fish and\nGame officers and a small team from the Mountain Rescue Service headed up the\ntrail at around 7 p.m. The\nteam began their search\njust below treeline, where\na second beacon signal had\nsuggested Matrosova might\nhave sought shelter. After\nseveral hours of searching,\nit became clear the beacon\nwas sending faulty messag-\nes. The rescue team turned\nback in worsening weather.\n     A larger rescue team,\nincluding members of An-\ndroscoggin Valley Search\nand Rescue, hiked up the\nnext day in equally bad con-\nditions.

She appeared to have been\nblown over by a strong gust of wind and was found with her headlamp on. The\nlikely cause of death was hypothermia. (Sources: SAR personnel and news reports.)\n\nANALYSIS\n  Severe wind and freezing temperatures were the main contributing factors in\nMatrosova\u2019s death. Matrosova was an experienced mountaineer, having climbed\n Rainer, Denali, and Aconcagua, but her lightweight, in-a-day approach to the tra-\nverse left her without the equipment to bivouac in such conditions. Knowing the\nweather forecast, recognizing when the weather is too extreme to continue, and\naltering a plan accordingly are extremely important parts of any mountaineering\nendeavor. The Mount Washington Observatory\u2019s website (www.mwobs.org) posts\nan accurate forecast each morning on temperature, wind speed, and wind chill for\nthese mountains.\n     Carrying an emergency locater beacon on a solo hike or climb can increase\nsafety, but not as much as a partner or bivouac gear. Moreover, this incident shows\nthat beacon signals can be misleading to searchers, and they cannot be relied upon\nas your first line of defense. (Source: The Editors.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nShawangunks, The Trapps\nOn Labor Day I planned to lead Thin Slabs for the first time, having only followed\nthe climb once before. We wanted to do the direct start (5.7) and the challenging\ndirect finish (5.7+). I made it through the first hard moves on pitch one clean, with\ngood gear. My buddy led pitch two to the Grand Traverse Ledge. We looked at the\ndirect finish for a while and decided to go for it. I got a good piece in and clipped\nthe first two pins along the rightward traverse under the roof with long runners,\nthen backed down to the corner to rest. I did not clip the last pin since I\u2019d heard it\nwas sketchy and saw it was probably the weakest one.\n     Once I was ready, I went for it and made the moves all the way out to the end.\nJust as I brought my right foot up to finish the crux it slipped, my hand came off,\nand I was swinging in space. We estimated it was about a 12-foot pendulum fall.\nMy right foot hit first\u2014I heard a pop and saw my ankle dislocate. Fortunately, my\npartner, Skip Thompson, kept a cool head. He lowered me to the ledge, found a\nlong stick as a crutch, and set me up for a lower on our 70-meter rope. As I was\nlowered, I used the stick to keep my foot off the wall and stay in balance. Once on\nthe ground we called 911. At the hospital, X-rays showed a fracture and dislocation,\nwhich the ER doctor reduced. The next day I had surgery to put in three screws.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis climb is rated 5.7+, and I have led 5.8 at the Gunks, so it was within my ability.\nAlso, I had followed this climb without falling. Placing one more cam would have\nlimited my swing and probably have prevented an injury. Clipping the last pin might\nhave helped. The good news is that all the gear I clipped held.

        "Details_Factors": "Darkness, Inadequate Communication\nHanging Rock State Park, Moore\u2019s Wall\nAfter completing one climb on September 17, Eli Huneycutt (20) and Will Apple (36)\nbegan climbing Zoo View (5.7+), a classic two-pitch route. Huneycutt successfully\nled the first pitch to the Crow\u2019s Nest belay ledge. Apple began the second pitch, but\nwas unable to negotiate a roof section. It was becoming dark and the pair decided\nto retreat. Apple left some gear under the roof so he could retreat to the Crow\u2019s\nNest. From here they were able to rappel to the ground.\n     Before leaving the area, they decided to retrieve the gear they\u2019d left behind.\nThey scrambled to the top of the route and set up a rappel with their 70-meter\nrope. Apple descended over the roof and then realized the doubled rope (with rope\nends knotted) was too short to reach the Crow\u2019s Nest. Huneycutt noted, \u201cAll of\na sudden he says, \u2018I\u2019m at the end of my rope, literally\u2019\u2026. I really got scared at one\npoint where he was able to touch the rock wall and was able to stand up. I felt the\nweight go off of the rope and yelled down to him, \u2018Are you still there?\u2019\u201d\n     The confused communication caused Huneycutt to call rescuers and say he\nand his climbing partner were stranded on Moore\u2019s Wall, when in fact Apple had\nalready begun a self-rescue. Apple executed a leg wrap with the remaining rope to\nhalt his rappel and was able to retrieve the gear left behind. Using the equipment\nhe had with him (mostly slings and carabiners), he was able to ascend the rope\nmore than 100 feet, taking approximately one hour to rejoin Huneycutt. They met\nrescuers as they were walking out the trail. (Sources: Will Apple, news reports.)\n\nANALYSIS\nClimbers should familiarize themselves with descent routes and equipment re-\nquirements before attempting an unknown descent. A second rope would have\nbeen helpful in this situation, along with a headlamp. (Apple was able to use his\nsmartphone as a light source.) In most cases, attempts at self-rescue should be\nexhausted before calling for rescue. With some effort and improvisation, Apple\nsuccessfully got himself out of a difficult spot. Once they were both on top, the\nclimbers should have called back to inform rescuers they were safe. (Sources: Will\nApple, Karsten Delap, Aram Attarian.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience, Inadequate Belay\nBirdsboro Quarry, Orange Sunshine Wall\nOn September 27, I took my girlfriend climbing at Birdsboro Quarry. I had been\nclimbing for about five years, but she had never belayed a leader. I quickly showed\nher how to belay, then led the easiest routes, 5.3 to 5.5, and set up top-ropes so she\n could climb. She had not brought a helmet, so I loaned her mine. At the end of the\nday, I decided to sneak in something slightly harder but still well within my comfort\nzone: Dirty Swing, a 5.7 route on the Orange Sunshine Wall.\n     There were a few factors that should have deterred me from attempting this\nlast route, including the fact that I had no chalk, I had only that day taught her how\nto lead belay, and she is about 80 pounds lighter than me, but I was anxious to get\nin as much climbing as possible.\n     Without anchoring her to anything, I tied in and started climbing, hardly tak-\ning a look up at the route. I made it past the crux and after the last bolt noticed an\nabnormally long runout before what appeared to be two sets of bolted anchors,\none to my left and one to my right. I paused on a tiny ledge about 10 feet up from\nthe last bolt, assessing the options, and the next thing I knew I was falling, probably\nhaving slipped on some loose rock. I fell about 20 feet, with my legs outstretched\nand knees locked, and landed straight onto my left foot on a small ledge. After\nflipping over, I stopped upside-down a few feet above the ground. My girlfriend\nhad been yanked off the ground and was hanging above me. My left talus had been\nfractured, with my foot pointing out and to the left at a very gross angle.\n     First responders from Robeson Township drove me out to a waiting ambu-\nlance. I now have plates on either side of my ankle, and I wasn\u2019t able to walk for\nseveral months.\nANALYSIS\nI disobeyed one of the principles of the Mountaineers\u2019 Climbing Code: \u201cNever let\njudgment be overruled by desire when choosing the route or turning back.\u201d De-\nspite not having chalk, not knowing anything about the route, and being with an\ninexperienced partner who weighed much less than me (and was not anchored),\nI went for it anyway. Midway up the climb, when I looked down and was slightly\nfrightened to see a large loop of rope out from her belay, I simply told her to \u201cmake\nsure to take in some of the slack\u201d and continued on.\n     Also, if I had read the comments on the Mountain Project page for this route,\nI would have learned of the two anchors and long runout from the last bolt, and\nknown that the left was the one to go for. Finally, I was insanely lucky not to have\nhit my head. I always wear a helmet, but this day I had loaned it to my girlfriend\nbecause of the area\u2019s reputation for loose rock.

I was climbing nearby and saw the accident.\nA friend of the climber scrambled to the ledge from an adjacent climb, and then\nI climbed up with some extra gear. While the friend stabilized the patient\u2019s head\nand neck, I clove-hitched the climber\u2019s rope into the first bolt on the route. (The\n rope above was clipped into draws on the first and second bolts, with no quickdraw\nclipped to the third bolt.) The patient was conscious but confused and complaining\nof pain at the back of his head. I noticed a rope burn behind his left calf.\n     When paramedics arrived, about 15 minutes after the accident, they sent up a\ncervical collar, which I placed on the patient. High-angle rescuers arrived shortly\nafterward and set up a line to lower the patient to the ground.

Smal-\n len was able to pendulum off the anchor to the right and avoid being hit, but then\nswung back on the anchor after the rockfall passed.\n     At this point, Dec and Smallen were both hanging with their full weight on the\nanchor. Dec looked up to see that the rockfall had completely severed one leg of\nthe anchor sling, and both climbers were now hanging from the master point with\nthe intact leg of the sling clipped to the other anchor bolt. In addition to half the\nanchor sling being cut, the group\u2019s two ropes suffered a total of four core shots,\nand both belay bolts and the biners that were attached to them were smashed to\nvarying degrees. After assessing Dec\u2019s injuries, the climbers added gear to the an-\nchor and descended.\nANALYSIS\nAnchor construction and connection is often debated, but in this scenario there is\nno question that clipping the master point of a redundant anchor, which would not\nextend, saved two lives. If a sliding X (a.k.a. magic X) had been used to equalize the\nsling or cordelette, without extension-limiting knots, the anchor likely would have\nfailed completely and the climbers likely would have been killed.\n     Weather may have contributed to there being a loose block on this well-trav-\neled route. The winter in Utah started off cold and wet and then went dry and\nwarm. There was a substantial freeze/thaw cycle in the canyon that may have been\nenough to loosen the large block. In such areas it\u2019s good to be wary of loose rock\nearly in the season. (Source: Carl Dec, Red River Adventures.)\n\n",

        "Details_Factors": "Little Cottonwood Canyon, Pfeifferhorn\nDuring the afternoon of February 1, Susan DeBruin (30) and Derek DeBruin (27)\nhiked in to Maybird Gulch above Little Cottonwood Canyon and established camp\nwith the intention of climbing the Pfeifferhorn (a.k.a. Little Matterhorn Peak) the\nfollowing day. A small amount of snow fell overnight, accompanied by winds of\nperhaps 40 to 50 mph. The following morning the party waited for the warmth of\nsunrise and then left camp around 7:30 a.m. to attempt the north ridge, approach-\ning via the snow couloir on the east side of the ridge.\n      Once on the ridge, Derek established a belay in anticipation of the terrain\nabove, largely 4th-class to low 5th-class rock, blanketed with snow and occasion-\nally coated with verglas. The pair donned crampons and Derek began leading a\nseries of short pitches (50\u201375 feet) up ledges and corners. After leading the fourth\npitch, Derek established a belay and Susan began climbing.\n      Moments after she stepped off the ledge, she was struck by a rock on the top\nof her helmet. While startled and injured, she was coherent and shouted to Derek.\nThey agreed the simplest plan would be for her to climb the 50 feet to Derek, and\nhe could then inspect her injuries.\n      Susan arrived at the belay a few minutes later. Her cervical spine was free of\npain, she had no sensory or neuromotor deficits, and she was completely respon-\nsive. Two of her teeth were chipped, one was cracked, and her tongue was badly\nbitten. She reported general pain in her teeth and jaw, and her neck muscles were\nstiff and painful. Her helmet suspension was completely undone, and the helmet\nshell had a large gouge in it.\n      The party rappelled from their belay stance off the east side of the ridge into\na couloir. Given the low snowpack in the Wasatch that year, this couloir was barely\nfilled, with about 10 to 15cm of faceted snow atop rock slab. Another rappel placed\nthem in downclimbable terrain. Given the relatively slow pace of the descent, Der-\nek became quite chilled and developed minor frostbite in a few toes. Once at camp,\nthe two took a break and warmed up. The pain prevented Susan from eating, but\nshe was able to drink. They then struck camp, hiked back to the trailhead, and\nfound a dentist.\nANALYSIS\nThe north ridge is the most popular technical climbing route on the Pfeifferhorn\nand is the cleanest option available, but is still fraught with detached granite blocks\nand unstable sections. Consequently, most parties attempt the route during the\nwinter, when the rock is often frozen in. Given the low snowpack that winter, the\nroute may have been looser than normal. It is possible that spontaneous rockfall\noccurred, but it seems most likely that Derek dislodged a rock when he tensioned\nthe rope to belay Susan from above.\n      In this terrain, the team could have traveled without a rope or simul-climbed,\nbut this would not eliminate the risk of rockfall or loose holds causing a serious\nfall. The best solution in such a scenario is likely traveling on a shortened rope for\nsmall distances (perhaps 10 or 15 feet at a time) and establishing quick but adequate\nbelays for the follower, keeping in mind the danger of falling ice and rock when\nchoosing a belay location.

        "Details_Factors": "Loose Rock, Descending Unroped\nLittle Cottonwood Canyon, Gate Buttress\nOn March 29, Emir Alikadic (38) and Thomas Gappmayer (27) had just finished\nclimbing Tingey\u2019s Terror (5.7), a multi-pitch route on the Gate Buttress. After hav-\ning lunch on top, the two decided to descend via a rappel into Green Adjective\nGully, a popular cragging zone on the west side of Gate Buttess. The two traversed\ntoward a set of anchors reached by a short, easy downclimb to a ledge. Just before\nAlikadic reached the ledge, the large flake he was holding for balance pulled out.\nHe managed to push it out of the way of his chest and legs, but lost his balance and\nstarted tumbling backward. He desperately tried to grab rocks or trees as he fell,\nbut to no avail. After falling approximately 50 feet, just before he went over the lip\nof the cliff, the rope he was carrying on his back in a mountaineer\u2019s coil snagged a\nfeature on the rock and caught him.\n      Alikadic managed to grab a tree and pull into an alcove just below the lip of the\ncliff. This alcove contained anchors for the route Mother of Pearl (5.11+), which a\nparty had just finished climbing, leaving a rope through the anchors. He assessed\nhis injuries and found a swollen ankle, blood on the back of his head, loss of skin\nand bleeding on the hands and forearms, and broken fingernails from clawing at\nthe rock as he fell. The rope suffered multiple core shots and the sheath was melt-\ned in several sections, even fusing two strands at one point.\n      Since Alikadic was conscious and felt he had full mental function, the two de-\ncided to self-rescue. Alikadic rappelled the rope set up on Mother of Pearl and got\ndown into the gully, while Gappmayer descended with the help of another climber.\n Alikadic was met by several others at the base of the cliff, one of whom happened\nto be an EMT. She assessed his injuries and suggested he wait for emergency ser-\nvices, but he decided to continue the descent unaided. The climber scrambled and\nhiked down to the parking lot, where he was met by police and EMTs, who released\nhim after examining his injuries.\nANALYSIS\nThe fact that this incident didn\u2019t end in a fatality can largely be attributed to luck.\nThe fall could have been mitigated or avoided by roping up for the easy yet semi-\ntechnical downclimb to the anchor. The flake that pulled out was identified by the\nvictim and his partner as potentially unstable, mere moments before the accident.\nHis instincts had warned him against touching it, and he had avoided stepping on\nit, but he didn\u2019t think it would dislodge with the minimal force he placed on it for\nbalance. Whenever there is doubt about scrambling unroped over exposed terrain,\nor if low-quality rock is present, don\u2019t hesitate to belay a short section.\n     Alikadic was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. He and his part-\nner had taken them off while having lunch, and he had never bothered to put it\nback on. (It was clipped on the back of his harness and was broken during the fall.)\nThough his head injury was fortunately only a minor laceration, it could have been\navoided had he been wearing his helmet. Rappelling is a frequent cause of rockfall,\nas climbers move over the rock and maneuver the ropes. Keep the helmet on until\nsafely out of any rockfall zone. (Source: Emir Alikadic.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Anchor, Piton Pulled Out\nCanyonlands National Park, Monster Tower\nOn May 30, a 47-year-old man from Colorado was killed when his anchor failed\nwhile descending Monster Tower, above the White Rim in Canyonlands National\nPark. The victim, Climber A, was climbing with two companions, Climber B (27) and\nClimber C (15). The weather was hot, and in addition to their climbing gear all three\ncarried daypacks with food, water, and extra clothing.\n     After some trial and error, the group found the base of the Kor Route (5.10 R),\ntheir intended climb for the day. The approach to the base of the route involves\nabout 50 feet of 4th-class scrambling with a short section of easy 5th class. The\nthree noted that this section, while easy on the way up, might be more difficult to\ndownclimb with their packs at the end of the day. They opted to leave two of the\npacks above the scramble, at the start of the actual route, and climb the tower with\none small pack. They anchored to an old piton at the base of the Kor Route, and\nClimber A began leading.\n     After climbing through pitch five, only Climber A wanted to continue to the\nsummit, as the others were getting tired and thirsty. They considered rappelling,\nbut didn\u2019t want to descend on the worn and aged anchors of the Kor Route, so af-\nter Climber A topped out, he lowered back to the other two climbers, and all three\ndescended via the bolted anchors of the North Ridge Route. The three reached the\nsaddle between Monster Tower and Washer Woman without incident and contin-\nued to the ground.\n     They still had to retrieve the packs at the base of the Kor Route. Climber A, fol-\nlowed by Climber B, hiked around the tower and scrambled up the approach again,\n planning to lower the packs off the old\npiton at the base and then either rap-\npel or scramble back down. Climber A\nthreaded the rope through the piton and\nset up a rappel as Climber B changed out\nof her climbing shoes. Climber A began\nrappelling, and then Climber B heard the\nsound of metal pulling out of the rock\nand a yell, and she saw that the piton and\nrope were gone. Climber C was scream-\ning but didn\u2019t respond to questions from\nClimber B. Within about five minutes,\nClimber B had downclimbed the ap-\nproach to Climber A, who was tangled in\nthe climbing rope, with the old piton still\nattached. His skin was white. Climber B\nfound no pulse or respiration. They had\na cell phone signal, and Climber B told\nClimber C to call 911 while she began\nCPR. Climbers B and C performed CPR\nfor the next hour while communicating\nwith climbing rangers and the sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment.\n     With daylight fading, the SAR team\ndecided there wasn\u2019t enough light to Approaching the Kor Route on the east side\ndeploy a helicopter and were forced to of Monster Tower in Canyonlands. The piton\ndrive in to the basin. They reached the anchor that failed was located at the base of\n                                            the obvious chimney crack.\nparty at the base of the tower around\nmidnight and helped Climbers B and C back to the vehicles, where they all camped\nfor the night. The next morning, a helicopter was sent in to retrieve Climber A\u2019s\nremains.\nANALYSIS\nThough Monster Tower is remote, it receives regular ascents, and several climbers\nin an online forum attested to having recently rappelled off the same piton without\nincident. Nonetheless, antiquated fixed hardware, especially in the soft sandstone\nof the desert, should be thoroughly bounce-tested (with a backup) before commit-\nting to it. When rappelling off fixed gear, it\u2019s always prudent to back up the anchor\nwith removable pieces when possible, until the last climber descends. And if there\nis any doubt about the integrity of a single piece of gear, leave a backup.\n     According to Climber B, the unexpected heat of the day and the resulting\nexhaustion and dehydration likely contributed to their decision-making, both in\nchoosing to rappel instead of downclimb from the base of the climb, as well as to\nrappel off the piton without testing or backing it up. Carry plenty of water when\nclimbing in the desert, especially during the hotter months. (Source: Anonymous\nfirst-hand account.)\n\n    Editor\u2019s note: Another incidence of fixed-anchor failure was reported at the end\n of November on the Turtle Wall, near St. George, Utah. A climber had finished a sport\nclimb at the sandstone crag and clipped one of the two anchor bolts, moved a little\nhigher, and then fell or let go. The bolt failed and he was caught by the highest pro-\ntection bolt, hitting a ledge but fortunately without injury. The glue-in anchor bolt\nhad pulled out of the rock when some of the soft sandstone around it blew out. This\nclimber was fine because he was still on belay and clipped to protection, but it\u2019s a good\nreminder to always clip into both bolts at a sport anchor before untying to clean the\nanchor or rappel.",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Equipment, No Backup\nGreen Peak, Bat Caves\nOn October 21, GR, a 45-year-old male from Vermont, and TW, a 43-year-old male,\nwent to Green Peak near Dorset to climb in the Bat Caves area. They hiked to the\ntop of a 40- to 50-foot cliff, where they used a static line to anchor themselves as\nthey set up a top-rope anchored to a pair of bolts.\n     After completing the setup, the men decided to rappel the steep face rather\nthan take the trail back to the base of the cliff. GR went first, even though he was\nthe less experienced climber. He threaded their 7mm dynamic rope through his\nbelay device, a Black Diamond ATC. His partner observed that the rope was too\nthin for the ATC, and suggested that GR add a second carabiner for additional\nfriction, since he wasn\u2019t using a friction hitch or other backup. However, GR pro-\nceeded to rappel with a single carabiner connecting the ATC to his harness, and he\nstarted the rappel by jumping away from the cliff. As he dropped out of sight, TW\nheard him yell. Rather than rappel, TW descended the trail to the base and found\nhis friend dead, with severe head trauma. GR was not wearing a helmet.\nANALYSIS\nThis accident was caused by improper use of equipment and inadequate rappel\nbackup, which stripped GR of any ability to control his speed or stop his descent.\nBlack Diamond recommends the ATC be used only with ropes that are 7.7mm or\nthicker (up to 11mm). As his friend suggested, GR could have clipped a second cara-\nbiner through the bights of the rappel ropes, adjacent to his main locking cara-\nbiner, creating additional friction in the system. He also could have employed a\nbackup below the belay device by tying a friction hitch\u2014a klemheist, Prusik, or\nautoblock\u2014with a piece of accessory cord. Alternatively, he could have rappelled\nafter his more experienced partner, who could have given GR a fireman\u2019s belay by\ntensioning the ropes from below to control his descent.\n     GR initiated the rappel by jumping out and away from the cliff, instead of pro-\nceeding slowly until he was confident that his rappel setup was adequate to control\nhis speed. We do not know whether GR tested his setup while still safely anchored;\nif he had, he might have noticed the lack of friction in the system before untether-\ning from the anchor.

        "Details_Factors": "Failure To Retie Knot Before Lowering\nHidden Valley\nOn December 20, Jennifer Kendall \u201cKayah\u201d Gaydish (36) fell from the anchors atop\na sport route in the Ginseng area. An on-scene climber/paramedic and local EMS\nwere unsuccessful in reviving her.\n     The route has a set of hangers with rings at the top. From what is known, the\nclimber initially intended to rappel. She experienced some difficulty with the setup\nand decided to lower instead. While transitioning she hung from two daisy chains,\npulled up a few feet of rope, tied a bight, and clipped it to her harness to prevent\ndropping the rope. (The bight was found attached to her harness when rescu-\ners arrived.) She then untied the rope from her harness to thread it through the\nanchors in preparation for being lowered. It\u2019s at this point in the transition where\nno one really knows what happened. She called down to her belayer, asking to be\nput back on belay. She leaned back, her belayer felt some tension (which may have\nbeen the rope passing through the anchors), and then fell to the ground 50 to 60\nfeet below. She was still on belay when she fell, and no miscommunication was re-\nported. (Sources: Rock and Ice magazine, news reports, and local climbers.)\nANALYSIS\nIt appears the climber did not close the system by tying the rope back into her har-\nness after threading it through the anchor. Her decision to switch her descent plan\nfrom rappelling to lowering may have caused some confusion.\n     Whenever possible, climbers should leave their anchor tether(s) clipped while\nweighting the rope after retying through anchors, in order to test the system. If\nthis is not possible, a careful visual check should be made before unclipping one\u2019s\ntethers. Going through a verbal checklist with the belayer may also be helpful.\n(Source: The Editors.)\n     Editor\u2019s note: A video tutorial demonstrating a good method for threading and\ncleaning a rappel anchor without going off belay can be found at americanalpineclub.\norg/best-practices.\n                                                                The north side of Mt.\n                                                               Stuart, with the Ice Cliff\n                                                               Glacier, narrowing to a\n                                                               couloir near its top, left\n                                                               of the prominent north\n                                                               ridge.

        "Incident_Type": "WASHINGTON\nFALL ON SNOW",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nMt. Stuart, Ice Cliff Glacier\nAbout midnight on February 16, Eric Strickler, 29, and Edward McFarlin, 28, left\ntheir base camp at 6,500 feet and navigated the steep snow and ice walls of the\nIce Cliff Glacier, past the bergschrund and into the final gully leading to the north-\neast shoulder. At 7:45 a.m., Strickler was belaying McFarlin up the last pitch of the\ngully, which was slightly corniced at the top. As he was climbing the cornice onto\nthe ridge, a snow step collapsed beneath McFarlin and he fell, ripping out his only\npiece of protection, a picket placed just below the cornice. McFarlin rapidly slid to-\nward his belayer, but Strickler was unable to arrest his fall. When their two-picket\nanchor failed, they fell another 800 to 1,000 feet onto the upper Ice Cliff Glacier.\n     Strickler was knocked unconscious in the fall, lost his helmet and pack, and was\nlater diagnosed with three fractured vertebrae (C1, C4, and C5). McFarlin fractured\nhis femur in two places. He managed to keep his backpack on, but the contents\nwere strewn across the snow. After Strickler regained consciousness, the climbers\nfound his personal locator beacon below them on the glacier and activated it. Their\nrepeated attempts to call 911 were unsuccessful because of their remote location.\nWhile McFarlin assessed their situation, Strickler went to get his pack, which had\nan extra sleeping bag, food, and water. The climbers then insulated their sitting\narea and kept calling 911.\n     An hour later, a call connected to the Chelan County Sheriff\u2019s Office and dis-\npatchers told them a ground team was being assembled. Eventually rescuers sent\na helicopter and told the climbers to make themselves visible, which they did with\nspace blankets and an orange sleeping bag. A rescuer lowered on a cable winch and\n strapped Strickler into a rescue harness before lifting him into the helicopter. The\nchallenging terrain kept rescuers from being able to put McFarlin on a backboard\nto protect his fractured femur, but he was also lifted into the chopper. Both men\nwere taken to Wenatchee Valley Hospital for treatment.\nANALYSIS\nThe climbers each had about half a dozen years of mountaineering and rock climb-\ning experience but were new to technical alpine ice routes. After the incident, they\nacknowledged they would have been better off choosing a less demanding route or\ntaking along somebody with more experience. With the semi-consolidated snow\nthey encountered during the climb, they should have used horizontally buried\npickets for anchors rather than vertically driving them in and clipping the top hole\nof the picket. Also, McFarlin was impatient to finish the last pitch and get out of the\ncold gully, so he climbed straight through challenging conditions on the cornice\nrather than stopping to establish a better anchor to protect the crux.\n     The two had packed well for an emergency, with extra layers, space blankets,\nlightweight sleeping bag, and personal locater beacon. In retrospect, they wished\nthey also had put a stove in their summit pack.

There were five interwoven loops of tied slings already wrapped around the\nboulder, but most were sun-bleached and worn. A new black sling was threaded\nthrough a steel rappel ring. Hagan chose to use this rappel anchor, but when he\nweighted the ropes, the webbing loop came untied and the ring slipped off the end.\nHagan tumbled about 60 meters to his death.\n      A recovered photo of the sling before Hagan used it showed a knot concealed\nby a lip of rock; one end of this knot had a tail at least three feet long. Inspection\nof the webbing after the accident showed an overhand knot near one end and no\nknot on the other end. Rangers believe the overhand knot was the remnant of\nan incomplete or incorrectly tied water knot intended to join the webbing ends.\nHagan may have felt enough friction from the long tail of webbing\u2014either lying in\nthe rocks or cinched inside the partially completed water knot\u2014to be convinced\nthe anchor was solid.\n      The anchor that failed had been left the previous day by another party. They\nhad anchored their rappel through the steel ring and the black webbing but also\nthreaded a strand of the existing, weathered webbing as their primary anchor, and\nthey never weighted the newly placed backup sling.\nANALYSIS\n Two possibilities can be considered for how the anchor failed. The party that set\nthe anchor may have placed it correctly with a water knot, and Hagan untied it to\nadjust the position but didn\u2019t retie it. Or the first party didn\u2019t tie the anchor cor-\nrectly but didn\u2019t realize this because the second piece of anchor webbing held their\nweight. Either way, Hagan failed to inspect his anchor adequately. Both Hagan and\nthe previous day\u2019s party were at the anchor near dark and may have felt time pres-\nsure. Hagan\u2019s belayer said the climb took twice as long as anticipated and was cold\nand windy, so Hagan was likely tired and rushed. A second, redundant anchor likely\nwould have prevented the accident.

Near 2 a.m., John (23) had just com-\npleted a solid lead of New Yosemite (5.9), using headlamps to light the way, but he\nwas unhappy with his lead because he felt he had \u201cstitched it up\u201d with too much\nprotection.\n     He then started up Four Sheets to the Wind (5.9+), placing multiple pieces of\nprotection as he moved through the lower roof, including a solid piece at the lip.\nHe headed up a corner to the upper roofs on the route, but rather than stop to\nplace gear, as his belayer recommended, John continued into the upper roof crux\nand then fell. His tie-in was about nine feet above his last piece of gear, and he fell\n22 feet before impacting the slab below the first roof. The climber immediately\ngrabbed his right ankle and asked to be lowered.\n     John\u2019s partner splinted the ankle using shoes and climbing tape and, with the\nhelp of friends, evacuated the climber to their parked vehicle. The climber had a\nfractured right calcaneus (heel) that required surgical intervention and implanta-\ntion of 15 screws. (Source: Anonymous report from the climbers.)\nANALYSIS\nThis incident occurred due to multiple factors, the most important being the lim-\nited visibility of a nighttime climb illuminated only by headlamps. This prevented\nan adequate assessment of the climb, potential gear placements, and fall zones.\nWithout being able to see the slab below him, John may have mistakenly believed\na fall would be safe because he had climbed around a roof. At the upper crux, he\nbelieved he did not have any pieces of the right size and chose to continue without\nadequate protection. To a lesser extent, pressure to climb within a limited time\nframe and his self-perception that he had overprotected the previous route were\ncontributing factors.

Moran, Sickle Couloir\nOn May 17, four ski mountaineers were involved in an avalanche in the Sickle Cou-\nloir on the northeast face of Mt. Moran (12,605 feet). Three of the men were carried\n500 to 600 vertical feet in the slide. They came to a stop on the surface, but one\ndied at the scene as a result of injuries and a second died after being flown from\nthe site by rescue helicopter. A third had lesser injuries.\n     The Sickle Couloir gains about 3,000 vertical feet and is given a mountaineer-\ning rating of Grade III 5.4. The four men in this incident were all very experienced\nski mountaineers and were well equipped.\n     At 6:15 a.m., after crossing Jackson Lake by boat, the four men began their as-\ncent to the Sickle Couloir Ba-\nsin on foot. They did not en-\ncounter any snow until they\narrived in the basin at ap-\nproximately 7,500 feet. Here,\nthey noted evidence of wide-\nspread wet avalanche debris\nthat had been deposited\nsometime in the previous 24\nhours. They discussed this\nobservation and concluded\nthat most of the significant\nrecent snowfall would have\nbeen flushed from the Sickle\nCouloir, thus reducing the\navalanche hazard. However,\ndue to cloud cover, they were The northeast face of Mt. Moran with the Sickle Couloir in\nnot able to see the conditions center.

Rene Etter-Garrette\n     They continued upslope\n on skis until they switched to crampons at the base of the couloir and began the\nactual climb unroped. The bed surface of the snow was very hard, with a thin,\none- to two-centimeter layer of new snow lying on top. All four were climbing with\na Whippet (self-arresting ski pole grip) in one hand and a normal ski pole in the\nother. After climbing approximately 600 feet, the group stopped for a short food\nand water break at an elevation near 9,900 feet. All four climbers were within five\nto six feet of each other.\n     The party heard potential avalanche activity above them. Seeing the oncoming\nsnow, one of the surviving skiers moved slightly left and gripped the Whippet that\nhe had forced into the firm snow. As the snow was hitting his right foot, he recalled\nthe snow as being fairly slow-moving and relatively shallow (less than boot-top\ndeep). He also felt that it took approximately two to three seconds for the snow to\npass. After the snow had passed, he looked up to see that the others were gone.\n     The slide carried the other three through some narrow, very steep terrain\nwhere they most likely sustained their traumatic injuries while bouncing off the\nrock and firm snow. None of the three was buried for significant time during the\nevent. The remaining skier descended immediately and began first aid. A call was\nmade to 911 at 9:33 a.m. Continued snow sloughs forced him to move the most\nseriously injured skier to a safer location before help arrived. A large rescue effort\nensued. Despite difficult flying conditions, all members of the party had been air-\nlifted from the scene by 2:30 p.m.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Sickle Couloir is a committing climb and ski descent in the best of conditions.\nAn unroped fall in the steep section of the couloir, either climbing or skiing, would\nlikely be unstoppable.\n     In the preceding weeks, multiple storm systems had deposited new snow at\nthe higher elevations in the Teton Range, with rain at the lower elevations. Accord-\ning to the Bridger Teton Avalanche Center\u2019s weekly snowpack summary, the most\nrecent storm (May 7 to 9) had deposited a total of 21 inches of new snow, with over\ntwo inches of moisture, to higher elevations. Another storm system deposited 10\ninches of new snow and an inch of water at the Rendezvous Bowl weather station\nduring the period from May 15 to 16. While the party did experience light snowfall\nduring their ascent of the couloir on May 17, the firm conditions in the couloir\nserved to confirm their assumption that some snow had already slid and that the\nhazard was reduced.\n     The Sickle Couloir, and the terrain that feeds it, would concentrate any old or\nfresh snow that avalanched. While the avalanche that occurred was not large, it did\nentrain enough snow in the steep couloir to cause three of the four to fall.\n     A party\u2019s decision to go into the mountains is personal. Factors to be consid-\nered are the team\u2019s experience, abilities, fitness level, environmental conditions,\nand the acceptable level of risk exposure. Reports and evidence indicate the mem-\nbers of this team had the experience, ability, and fitness for the objective.\n     Fatal avalanche and/or ski mountaineering accidents seem to be on the rise\nin Grand Teton National Park. One to two of these events have been experienced\neach year for at least the past five years. Not only are these events traumatic for\nthe parties and families involved, they can also expose rescuers to significant, if not\n extremely, hazardous conditions.\nWhile some amount of exposure\nis ever present in the mountains,\nmountaineers and rescuers alike\nmust employ objective, prudent,\nand conservative judgment to\nminimize that exposure where\npossible.

        "Details_Factors": "Off-Route\nMiddle Teton, Dike Route\nOn August 11, while attempting to climb the Dike Route on the Middle Teton,\nClimber 1 and Climber 2\u2014brothers with 39 years of climbing experience in the\nTetons\u2014got off-route. Unable to locate the top of the Dike Pinnacle, a prominent\nfeature of the route, the brothers began downclimbing and rappelling toward the\nSouth Fork of Garnet Canyon. Due to exhaustion and uncertainty about the terrain\nthey encountered, the brothers requested a rescue.\n    At approximately 3:30 p.m., the brothers called the Jenny Lake Ranger Station\nand spoke to rangers, who made several attempts to direct them to easier terrain.\nThese efforts failed, possibly due to the team\u2019s level of fatigue and fear.\n      Unsure of exactly where the pair was in relation to the lower Dike Route, and\nwith concern for the party\u2019s mental and physical state, as well as continued re-\nquests for a rescue, rangers decided the best option was to either assist the pair\nby walking them off the mountain or to helicopter short-haul the pair to Lupine\nMeadows.\n     At 5:44 p.m. a helicopter left Lupine Meadows with three rangers onboard to\nconduct a reconnaissance. After a brief search, they located the pair on a large\ngrassy ledge to the looker\u2019s left of the route. It was obvious that a rescue involving\nrangers climbing to the scene would be long and risky to the rescuers, so it was\ndecided to mount a short-haul operation. Ranger Edmonds was short-hauled to\nthe scene from Lupine Meadows. Edmonds placed both climbers in screamer suits,\nand the two were short-\nhauled to Lupine Mead-\nows. The mission con-\ncluded at 8:40 p.m.\nANALYSIS\nAlthough many climbers\nconsider the Dike Route to\nbe easy (5.5/5.6), those at-\ntempting it must remem-\nber that it is very long,\nwith almost 3,000 vertical\nfeet of climbing through\ncomplex terrain. Parties The Screamer Suit is often used to assist with helicopter\ndescending the route from evacuation of patients with no spinal injuries.\npoints other than the sum-\nmit of the Middle Teton must be prepared for route-finding through loose rock\nthat is much more challenging and complicated than the standard Middle Teton\ndescent via the Southwest Couloir. Both climbers had researched the route in both\nguidebooks and online guides. They appeared to be well informed about the ascent\nroute, but not well versed in their descent options, should they need to exit the\nroute early.

        "Details_Factors": "Poor Position, Stuck Rappel Rope\nGrand Teton, Stettner Couloir\nOn the night of August 15, at about 8:45 p.m., Teton Interagency Dispatch received\na cell phone call stating that six persons were stranded in the Stettner Couloir.\nThe subjects had climbed the Petzoldt Ridge and then rappelled into the couloir.\nThey said that they rappelled through several waterfalls, were cold, and that their\nropes were stuck. Due to the nature of the terrain and the onset of darkness, they\nwere told that rescuers could not reach them until the next morning. The party\nwas provided with strategies for both continued descent and for staying at their\nlocation and keeping warm.\n    At about 11:30 p.m., the incident commander recontacted the reporting party\nand learned that their group had joined forces with another party, and that they\nwere now rappelling together. (The climbers were mostly in their 20s, with one\n group leader age 59.) The reporting party said she expected them to make it to the\nLower Saddle that night, and two people did reach the Lower Saddle, where they\nwere provided with sleeping bags for rewarming.\n     At about 5:45 a.m. on August 16, the incident commander received a text mes-\nsage from one of the party members stating that they were still stranded in the\nStettner Couloir, that they were cold and wet, and that they needed rescue. Several\nrescuers climbed to the scene, and numerous others hiked and flew to the Lower\nSaddle to assist the subjects across the ledges at the base of the couloir. Eight peo-\nple were evacuated out of the gully via rope rescue and escorted across the ledges\nto the Lower Saddle. Four of those individuals were flown from the Lower Saddle\nto Lupine Meadows because they were too incapacitated to hike out on their own.\nANALYSIS\nAlthough many of the climbers involved had reasonable amounts of experience\nclimbing in the Tetons, they started the ascent late\u2014the party of six arrived at the\nbase of the Petzoldt Ridge around 9 a.m. There were about ten people in front of\nthem, including one group of four or five people. They were repeatedly delayed by\nthe parties in front of them and arrived at the top of the Petzoldt Ridge\u2014still far\nbelow the summit\u2014at about 5 p.m.\n     Once on top of the ridge, the group decided they were not going to continue to\nthe summit (via the Upper Exum Ridge) due to the time of day. They had a discus-\nsion about descending via Wall Street (the normal descent from this location), but\ndecided that they were uncomfortable descending that route. However, rappelling\nthe Stettner Couloir proved to be a poor option because of wet terrain, stuck rap-\npel ropes, and exposure to rockfall. The climbers did not have the skills to ascend\ntheir stuck ropes to retrieve them, and after fixing their remaining rope and re-\nmants of two of the stuck ropes, they adopted unorthodox rappel techniques that\ncould have proved disastrous (rappelling with two climbers on one single strand,\none hanging from a tether beneath the other). Only two climbers were able to de-\nscend this way, leaving the others exposed to a cold night in wet clothing. When\nrappelling in lower-angle terrain with many obstacles, it\u2019s often better to do fre-\nquent shorter rappels, even if this requires building new anchors; full double-rope\nrappels greatly increase the risk of stuck ropes.\n     Researching the options for descent from a climb at various stages is as impor-\ntant as researching the ascent route. These climbers almost certainly would have\nbeen better off belaying each other across Wall Street and downclimbing the nor-\nmal route to the Lower Saddle.

        "Details_Factors": "Off-Route, Inadequate Gear\nGrand Teton National Park, Teewinot\nAt 7:30 a.m. on August 22, three women began hiking up the \u201cApex Trail\u201d from the\nLupine Meadows Trailhead in an attempt to climb Teewinot Mountain (12,325 feet).\nThe three climbers, all in their mid-20s, were attempting to ascend the standard\neast face route, a route that Climber 2 had done once before. They were climbing\nin trail shoes and were not carrying a rope or harnesses, but each did have a hel-\nmet. The east face route is 4th class and is frequently climbed without ropes, but\n good route-finding skills and mountaineering experience are needed.\n      The women followed a well-established climbers\u2019 trail to a point level with\nthe Worshipper and Idol rock towers. According to Climber 3, they stopped here,\nhad a snack, and put their helmets on. Somewhere above this point and before\nthe Narrows, they lost the main climbers\u2019 route and headed up to the north of the\nregular east face route. Believing they were now at the deep chimney adjacent to\nthe Narrows, they climbed higher into steep, technical terrain at approximately\n11,500 feet. They were now ascending a climb called the Black Chimney (5.6). They\nrock climbed several difficult pitches in their trail shoes.\n      After climbing around two or three large chockstones in the chimney, they\nwere about 250 feet above the last big ledge. The women traversed left, across a\nnarrow sloping ledge, and became increasingly certain that they were off-route.\nAccording to Climber 3, they had seen another climbing group below going a dif-\nferent way. The group discussed returning and going that way, but they were con-\ncerned about downclimbing what they had ascended.\n      According to Climber 3, she was on a small ledge to the right (north) of Climber\n2. Climber 1 was trying to find a way up steep rock above Climber 2. Climber 1\nfell about 10 to 15 feet and hit Climber 2, and Climber 3 watched the two bounce\nover the rocks multiple times, then disappear out of sight over the cliff. Climber 3\ndownclimbed 15 to 20 feet of easier terrain to a larger ledge. At approximately 11:15\na.m. she called 911. She yelled many times but could not get a response from her\nfriends. Both the climbers who fell died from their injuries. Climber 3 was short-\nhauled by helicopter from the ledge at 4:19 p.m.\nANALYSIS\nIt\u2019s often easy to convince yourself that you\u2019re on-route, matching terrain features\nto guidebook descriptions or memory. Had the climbers recognized that the in-\ncreased difficulty they encountered meant they were likely off-route, they might\nhave stopped, retraced their steps, and returned to easier ground before it was too\nlate. More appropriate footwear, with sticky rubber soles, might have given them\nmore confidence to downclimb and retreat. It is also not uncommon to utilize\nropes and rock protection to ascend and descend the normal route on Teewinot,\nwhen the rock is wet, icy, or when climbers feel uncomfortable with the exposure.\n(Sources: National Park Service Search and Rescue Report and the Editors.)",

The two\ndid not carry helmets, ice axes, crampons, ropes, or any other climbing gear. This\nequipment is not normally needed in late summer for a safe ascent of the peak,\nthough helmets are often recommended because the route is popular and there is\nmuch loose rock in the couloir.\n    The two had a successful climb of the peak. On the descent, they found them-\nselves at the top of a steep snow slope, north and east of the normal route, that\noften lingers all summer. They did not ascend this snow on their way up the peak\n earlier in the day. The snow on this slope is over 40\u00b0 and has a bad run-out into the\nboulder field below it.\n     According to Climber 2, Climber 1 intentionally stepped out onto this steep\nsnow, took one step, and immediately slid very fast down the length of the snow-\nfield (about 100 feet) and then tumbled an additional 50 feet through the boulders.\nClimber 2 called for help around noon on August 29 and reported that Climber 1\n(male, 22) was in and out of consciousness. Rangers responded by foot and heli-\ncopter, and the patient was short-hauled from the scene in a litter at 2:20 p.m.\nANALYSIS\nWhen descending the same route that was climbed on the way up the mountain, it\nis usually a good idea to follow the same line, provided the terrain was reasonable\nto ascend and fit the route descrip-\ntion. The snowfield where Climber\n1 lost his footing appears to offer a\ntempting shortcut back down into\nGarnet Canyon\u2019s South Fork, and\nthis is why numerous accidents\nhave occurred here. The snow in\nlate summer is very firm, and even\na climber well versed in the use of\nan ice axe would be challenged to\nself-arrest a fall on this slope. These\nclimbers had no axes.

Tony and Shawn\nhiked the short distance to the scene and found the two climbers, Jonathan Peter\nMacDonald (23) of Lander and Keith Murray Hendersen (57) of Cheyenne, deceased\nfrom their fall.\n      The evidence found at the scene showed that Keith had Jonathan on belay with\nabout 30 feet of rope in service. Jonathan was tied in to the rope with a figure 8,\nwhich was found tight as if from a fall. Keith had the rope through a belay device\nbut was not tied in to the other end of the rope. He was clipped into a piece of\nwebbing and a piece of cordelette, both of which were badly faded and frayed, and\nwhich appeared to be the remnants of an old rappel anchor. He was clipped to the\nold anchor using a single sling with non-locking carabiners. There was no other\ngear placed between the two climbers. Both climbers were wearing helmets, but\nJonathan\u2019s had come off during the fall. The reporting party stated he had seen the\ntwo climbers descending before their fall.\n     A few days later, Tip Top Search and Rescue received a phone call from a sepa-\nrate pair of climbers, Reuben and Breezy, who had encountered Keith and Jona-\nthan earlier that day on the northeast face. Reuben stated that they caught up to\nKeith and Jonathan after the first pitch, which is a traverse. Jonathan and Keith\nwere moving very slowly, and offered to let Reuben and Breezy pass, which they\ndeclined. Reuben stated they waited about 45 minutes while Jonathan and Keith\nclimbed the second pitch. Reuben led closely behind the others and then set up a\nbelay some distance above them. Reuben recalled hearing the two discussing that\nthey had underestimated the difficulty of the climb, that it was getting late already,\nand that they should retreat.\n     Reuben and Breezy pushed on and later recalled that Keith and Jonathan rap-\npelled down the second pitch but elected not to traverse back along the first pitch.\nInstead, they continued to rappel straight down the steep slabs below. Reuben\nstated he saw one of the climbers walking around on a ledge, looking for a way\ndown. Reuben and Breezy had no other contact with the pair but heard them yell\n\u201cRock\u201d at one point. They had no idea anything was wrong until they saw the heli-\ncopter respond to the base of the climb.\nANALYSIS\nWhile it is impossible to know exactly what happened to Keith and Jonathan, two\ndifferent parties saw them descending before the accident. It appears that Keith\nhad put Jonathan on belay to downclimb, traverse, or climb back up toward the\nroute line. One or both of them fell, and the old rappel anchor to which Keith was\nclipped then failed. Though both of the anchor slings were badly faded and frayed,\nthey were found still intact, which would lead one to believe that either the rock\nhorn holding the slings failed or the old slings came off the top of the horn. Lessons\nfrom this incident include:\n     \u2022 Back up or replace faded or tattered slings and cordage at anchors\n     \u2022 Test natural rock anchors (horns, chockstones, etc.) by pushing, pulling, and\n       knocking on the rock, with a backup if possible\n     \u2022 Research escape routes before a big climb and observe anchors and other\n       \u201cbail\u201d options as you climb\n     \u2022 Use locking carabiners for anchor tethers\n     \u2022 Make sure the chinstrap on a helmet is fastened snugly and securely\n     (Source: Tony Chambers, Tip Top Search and Rescue.)\n\n    Editor\u2019s note: Search \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d at publications.americanalpineclub.org for\nanother reported accident in the Wind Rivers in 2015.\n",

Logan,\nstarting on May 16, with the plan of traversing the summit plateau and skiing down\nthe normal route (King Trench). They had excellent weather and generally good\nconditions during the ascent, and they summited on June 2.\n     The next day the weather changed and an intense storm hit the team high on\nthe mountain. In order to reach their planned descent, the team needed to climb\nover a col between the east and main summits, at an altitude of approximately\n5,700 meters. During the traverse over the col in the storm, one member sustained\nfrostbite to both hands and became hypothermic. The team dug into a crevasse\non the col, where the climbers were pinned down for three days by intense wind\n(estimated 160 kph) and an estimated two meters of snowfall.\n     During a one-day break in the weather, the team traversed the plateau toward\nKing Trench but could not make it all the way across. Another four days of marginal\nweather followed. The team was unable to travel and risked refreezing the frostbit-\nten hands. Food and fuel supplies began to dwindle. A second climber began ex-\nperiencing intermittent symptoms of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). The\n team\u2019s low energy after 12 days of being at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters,\nthe frostbitten hands, and HAPE symptoms made them increasingly concerned\nthat they would not be able to safely reach the bottom of Kings Trench and a pre-\nplaced cache with their remaining supplies. On June 9, they called Parks Canada to\nrequest assistance.\n     The altitude and terrain at their location was at the upper limit for a helicopter\nrescue. A powerful A-Star B3 helicopter from Trans North helicopters was brought\nin for the job, and a second A-Star B3 with rescuers from Denali National Park was\nbrought in as backup. A team from Banff National Park trained in technical moun-\ntain rescue was put on standby and helped with logistics.\n     On June 11, a break in the weather occurred and a Visitor Safety team from\nKluane National Park was able to fly into the area and extract all three climbers,\nflying them back to Haines Junction. Three landings were required at 5,300 meters\non a glaciated plateau, with no options for escape if the weather moved in. The\npilot and rescue team pulled it off smoothly.\nANALYSIS\nThe summit plateau of Mt. Logan is an extreme place to be caught by severe\nweather. In order to descend the Kings Trench, climbers need to ascend 300 verti-\ncal meters to Prospector Col. A solid weather forecast, good fitness and acclimati-\nzation, good gear, and a bit of luck are essential for a safe descent off the mountain.\nSometimes these conditions align, but sometimes they do not.\n     This climbing team was well equipped and experienced, but they were unlucky\nto get some fierce weather.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Belay, No Helmet\nBritish Columbia, Skaha, Foreplay Wall\nOn June 7, a 38-year-old climber was leading a well-bolted 5.10a route on Fore-\nplay Wall. It was midafternoon on a hot day, and the 30-meter cliff was just com-\ning into the sun. The belayer (age about 42), with whom the leader had climbed\n\u201cmany times before,\u201d had returned to climbing after a two-year absence due to\ninjury. It was reported that the belayer had three years of experience and the\nleader had 15 years of experience. The climbers had borrowed a brand-new rope\nfrom another climber at the crag\u2014a 9.5mm rope with a water-resistant sheath.\nThe rope\u2019s owner had said it was slick on rappel, and had recently bought a new\ndevice to provide more friction. The belayer was using a standard Black Diamond\nATC belay device.\n     The leader reported that he climbed the route quickly and easily. He arrived at\nthe last bolt and either unexpectedly slipped or a hold broke. The belayer lost con-\ntrol of the rope and was unable to arrest the fall. The leader fell about 20 meters to\nthe base of the climb.\n     The climber landed on angled ground, which launched him face-first into\nsome rocks farther down the slope. The impacts resulted in a broken right cal-\ncaneus\u2014his shoe was split, and so was his heel to the bone\u2014and a deep left-heel\nlaceration. Multiple frontal facial lacerations were sustained, including a torn\nright nostril, and he had head trauma and a concussion. After two hours, the\ninjured climber was evacuated by helicopter. He spent six days in an intensive-\ncare unit.\n\nANALYSIS\nSeveral factors were identified by the climbers. The leader was climbing fast be-\ncause the route was easy for him, and the climbers were in a hurry to leave the crag\nnow that it was coming into the sun. There may have been excess slack in the rope\nwhen the leader slipped. The belayer was not located in an ideal position, close to\nthe wall, and when the rope came tight as the leader fell, the belayer tripped, com-\npromising his braking position. Consequently, the belayer was unable to stop the\nrope running through the device and his hands were burned.\n     Climbers must be cautious when using thin or new ropes, which tend to be\nmore \u201cslippery\u201d than ropes that have seen some use. The use of a tube-style or\nassisted-braking belay device specifically designed for thinner ropes might have\nhelped. Belay gloves also can help with controlling a severe fall. Fundamentally,\nhowever, a good belay stance and position, combined with proper braking tech-\nnique (brake hand held firmly on the rope below the belay device, ready for a fall),\nare the keys to preventing such accidents.\n     The leader typically wore a helmet when climbing, but elected not to wear it\non that climb because of the heat (about 35\u00b0C/95\u00b0F). He observed that the helmet\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t have provided much facial protection,\u201d but it might have helped with his\nother head injuries. \u201cI know am very lucky to come out without worse injuries, but\nI have for sure used up one of the nine lives,\u201d he said.

It had snowed lightly overnight and continued to snow\nduring the day. Later in the afternoon, they observed snow sloughing off the steep\ncliffs adjacent to the climb. The climbers reached the top at 4 p.m. and began rap-\npelling the route.\n     Just before dark the climbers reached a large snow slope in the middle of the\nclimb. The first climber began walking across the snow to set up the next rappel\nstation while the second climber coiled the ropes and put on his headlamp. At 6\np.m. the second climber reached the middle of the snow slope and observed his\npartner\u2019s tracks disappearing into a fresh avalanche fracture line. The avalanche\ndebris was spread out over the next two pitches of the ice climb, a distance of ap-\nproximately 200 meters.\n     The second climber rappelled down and spent two hours doing a visual search\nand probing likely spots in the avalanche debris with his climbing gear, but was\nunable to locate his partner. As the incoming storm intensified, he wisely decided\nto continue rappelling and arrived at his car at 11 p.m. At 11:30 p.m. he contacted\nthe Parks Canada Visitor Safety team via satellite phone from a nearby hostel to\nrequest assistance.\n     A Parks Canada team flew in to the site the next morning to do an aerial search\nbut was unable to locate any signs of the missing climber.

The storm arrived earlier than forecasted, with new snow accu-\nmulations of 10 to 12 centimeters during the day, increasing winds, and warming\ntemperatures. These changes caused hazardous snow conditions. The first climber\neither triggered the steep snow slope he was crossing or got hit by an avalanche\nfrom above while crossing the slope. Diligently monitoring conditions, watching\nfor clues such as sloughing, and being willing to turn back when changes occur are\ncritical when traveling in steep, confined avalanche terrain.\n      While many ice climbers choose to climb in avalanche terrain without carrying\navalanche rescue gear, this trend is beginning to change. In this case, avalanche\ngear would not have prevented the climber from dying, but it would have reduced\nthe time his partner spent searching for him under increasingly hazardous condi-\ntions. For the rescue teams, this would have significantly reduced the duration of\ntheir exposure to the avalanche slopes above the climb. Wearing gear with sewn-in\nRECCO reflectors also can substantially assist a rescue team.\n      Editor\u2019s note: A solo climber died in an avalanche from a snowfield on Polar\nCircus in 1982.

        "Details_Factors": "Near Miss With Rockslide\nAlberta, Banff National Park, Grand Sentinel from Moraine Lake\nOn August 15, 2014, Will Richardson-Little and I started hiking toward the Grand\nSentinel at 7:20 a.m. from the Moraine Lake parking lot. Our objective was to climb\nthe normal route on the south face (4 pitches, 5.9). We had a standard rack, double\nropes, and helmets.\n     We reached Sentinel\nPass about two hours later\nand started our descent to-\nward the Sentinel. Follow-\ning the guidebook descrip-\ntion, we scrambled along\nthe scree slopes on the\nleft side of the valley (the\nsame side as the Sentinel).\nThe rock was loose and un-\nsettled. A rock the size of a\ntennis ball fell past me, and\nI should have taken this as\na sign. It had rained lightly\nthe day before.\n     It took about 30 to 45 The climbers\u2019 shortcut from Sentinel Pass to the Grand Sentinel\nminutes to cross the scree is exposed to rockfall from Pinnacle Mountain. Eric Chow\n slope to reach the Sentinel. After we\u2019d completed the first pitch, between 10 a.m.\nand 11 a.m., we heard the sound of falling rock. A significant rockslide, lasting five\nminutes, occurred on the scree slopes we had just crossed, not half an hour earlier.\nThe rockslide was 50 to 100 meters wide. Large boulders, the size of milk crates\nor possibly larger, were hurtling down with alarming force. The thunder, cracks,\nand rumbles of the slide could be heard across the valley. After the rockslide, my\npartner and I realized that we were very lucky. If we had been caught in that area,\nwith nowhere to take cover, we both surely would have been killed.\nANALYSIS\nThe slide was likely due to warming temperatures in the late morning and melt-\ning snowpack high on Pinnacle Mountain, above the traverse. These conditions\nlikely caused a large boulder or boulders to be released from the snow. The subse-\nquent fall of these large rocks initiated a full rockslide. Scattered rockfall continued\nthroughout the day.\n     We completed the standard route on the Grand Sentinel (an excellent climb)\nand descended directly downhill from the Sentinel and across the valley to return\nby the hikers\u2019 trail. Our alternative route was on the opposite side of the scree\nslopes, adding about 15 minutes to the hike out.\n                                              This near miss taught us a good les-\n                                        son about being aware of objective hazards.\n                                        When the day\u2019s goal is a rock climb, it can\n                                        be easy to get shortsighted and forget that\n                                        there are other, bigger hazards all around.\n                                        In the alpine environment, it\u2019s smart to get a\n                                        very early start, even for a short rock climb.\n                                        (Source: Eric Chow.)\n\n                                          ",

        "Incident_Type": "FALL ON ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Incomplete Tie-In Knot\nQu\u00e9bec, Racine, Lac Larouche\nOn September 17, two female climbers in their 20s were top-roping a 5.10c route\ncalled Gueuse. One climber had just completed the route. The sun was going to\nset in 20 to 30 minutes. Everyone else at the crag had just left, so the two climbers\nwere alone.\n     The climber reported the incident as follows: \u201cI completed my figure 8 knot,\nbut at the exit of the knot I didn\u2019t leave enough rope. I left only 1.5 to 2 inches of\nrope. I really didn\u2019t feel like redoing my knot and had done this [in the] past with no\nissue. And I just started climbing without performing a partner check.\u201d\n     While exiting an overhang, her hand slipped. \u201cI fell away from the wall as the\nrope took my weight and slowed me down for a fraction of a second. The knot had\ncome undone [and] I was falling toward the ground.\u201d\n     The climber landed feet-first and ended up with a fractured calcaneus in her\nleft foot and a laceration on her right leg that needed five stitches. The belayer\nhelped the injured climber to hop from the forest back to the parking area, 500\nmeters away, and then drove her to the hospital.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe incident described is reminiscent of Lynn Hill\u2019s famous accident in Buoux,\nFrance, in which she fell at least 20 meters to the ground after failing to complete\na figure 8 tie-in. This is clearly what happened in the accident described above. A\nproperly and fully completed figure 8 will not suddenly untie or become detached.\nThe climber likely began threading the rope end to retrace the initial figure 8 and\nthen got sidetracked. As she pointed out, neither she nor her second checked her\nknot. In hindsight, the reporting climber acknowledged this was likely the case.\nDistraction may have been a factor, as well as fatigue or rushing because of the\nlateness of the day.\n     Always complete your tie-in without distraction, perform a check, and get\nyour partner to inspect your knot before you climb. Also assess your belayer\u2019s\nreadiness to belay.\n     It should be noted that the injured climber\u2019s partner left most of their gear in\norder to evacuate her partner. This was a good call. Unless the gear is required for\nrescue, first aid, evacuation, or safety, leave it behind. The rescuer\u2019s priority is the\ninjured climber.\n\n      Editor\u2019s note: In late March, a ski mountaineer broke through a cornice during\nthe famed Wapta Icefields traverse in the Canadian Rockies and survived a very long\nfall.

        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Self-Arrest\nDenali, West Buttress\nOn June 13, the six members of expedition \u201cExtreme Travel\u201d completed their ori-\nentation at the Talkeetna ranger station and flew to the Kahiltna Glacier to begin\na West Buttress climb. The team moved to 17,200-foot camp on the eighth day of\ntheir trip. Despite a more rapid ascent profile than normally recommended, all\nmembers of the group reported feeling well.\n   On June 22, four members of the expedition departed for the summit. During\ntheir descent in the early morning hours of June 23, one of the climbers lost his\nfooting and fell in the area of Zebra Rocks, at nearly 18,400 feet. This fall pulled the\nentire rope team off their feet, and none of the climbers was able to self-arrest on\nthe hard snow surface. One climber sustained a closed head injury and was unre-\nsponsive for approximately 10 minutes, while another climber sustained a chest\nwall injury and possible broken rib(s).\n   The two uninjured teammates descended to high camp in search of assistance.\nThey reached camp between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. and made contact with Alaska Moun-\n taineering School lead\nguide Rob Gowler, who re-\nlayed accident and patient\nstatus information to the\nNPS mountaineering rang-\ners via radio. Based upon\nthe severity of injuries re-\nported, incident command\ndecided that a helicopter\nrescue attempt would be\nmost prudent. Pilot An-\ndreas Hermansky flew to\n14,200-foot camp, where\nmountaineering       ranger\nColey Gentzel boarded for\na reconnaissance flight. A\nlenticular cloud over the\nmountain had descended\nto the area where the in- Moderately steep snow climbing in the Zebra Rocks area, above\njured climbers were locat- 18,000 feet on Denali\u2019s West Buttress Route. Dave Weber\ned and prevented a rescue\nattempt at that time. Hermansky returned to 7,200-foot camp to await an improve-\nment in weather conditions near Denali Pass.\n    Meanwhile, that morning, multiple teams had departed 17,200-foot camp,\nheaded toward the summit. At 8:25 a.m., Alpine Ascents International mountain\nguide Erin Pollock reached the location of the injured party. Pollock reported that\nboth the climber with the injured rib(s) and the climber with the suspected head\ninjury were ambulatory, and that, given these changes, the team felt they could\ndescend to high camp with assistance from climbers on the route. Over the next\nhour, several other teams arrived at Denali Pass and a plan was devised to help the\nclimbers back to camp. Blaine Horner of the \u201cCompass Data\u201d expedition (a former\nvolunteer with the NPS mountaineering rangers) abandoned his own summit at-\ntempt to assist the two men. Horner safely managed a nearly four-hour descent\nof the headwall to high camp, where they arrived at 1:10 p.m. The injured climbers\neventually descended the mountain under their own power.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis incident highlights an important principle regarding roped team travel. When\nsnow surface conditions are soft and conducive to self-arresting, it may be appro-\npriate to rely on rope teammates to stop the fall of another teammate. However,\nwhen the surface conditions become firmer, a team needs to add running protec-\ntion or belays for protection, as self-arrest becomes more difficult if not impos-\nsible. Belaying or adding intermediate protection during roped travel may also be\nprudent when the slope angle increases or the terrain below has greater conse-\nquences in the event of a fall (e.g., cliffs or crevasses below). Too many times, an\nentire rope team falls as a result of not being able to stop the fall of one teammate.\n(Source: Denali Mountaineering Rangers.)\n\n",

The team had planned to return to Talkeetna on foot and by packraft. At ap-\nproximately 6 p.m., while they were descending the boulder-strewn moraine of\nthe lower Granite Glacier, a large boulder rolled over and caused one climber to\nfall on his left side and arm.

        "Incident_Type": "AVALANCHE",
        "Details_Factors": "\nEastern Alaska Range, Canwell Glacier\nOn March 26, a group from a University of Alaska Fairbanks introductory moun-\ntaineering class was out for its final climb. The class consisted of nine students\n(ages 20\u201328), one lead instructor, and three volunteer assistant instructors. After\n11 weeks of class, including nine days of hands-on field time, the students were\ntasked with developing and executing a trip plan for their final group climb. The\nclass chose a snow climb on the northwest face of McCallum Peak, off the Canwell\nGlacier in the eastern Alaska Range.\n    This trip would involve a six-mile approach to a proposed campsite at around\n4,500 feet on a glacier on the north aspect of McCallum Peak. From there, the\nclimb would consist of glacier travel and climbing on moderate snow slopes, up to\n50\u00b0, to the summit at 6,700 feet. The students\u2019 plan was to leave early on Saturday\nto make the relatively flat approach to the campsite. If the avalanche conditions\nlooked favorable, the plan was to wake up early on Sunday, climb the peak, descend\nback to camp, and then ski back out to the road.\n     The eastern Alaska Range has a classic cold and thin continental snowpack. The\nclass had been into this area several times during the weeks preceding the climb,\non similar aspects and elevations as the proposed climb. We spent quite a bit of\ntime doing snow assessment during those trips, and at that time the stability was\nrelatively good in most locations.\n    Ten days before the attempted climb, a storm came through this part of the\nAlaska Range, bringing about 70cm of new snow and approximately 25 mph winds.\nDirectly after this storm,\nan advanced avalanche\ncourse was taught in the\ngeneral area of our objec-\ntive. The folks in this Avy 2\ncourse shared high-qual-\nity snow observations on\nthe Eastern Alaska Range\nAvalanche Center web-\nsite, about a week before\nour climb. The snow-\npack showed an exist-\ning wind slab, a potential\nweak layer of facets, and a\n                               The climbers\u2019 route along the Canwell Glacier. The X marks the\nmelt-freeze crust at 25cm point where the group chose a lower route. They entered avalanche\ndepth. The test results terrain while attempting to regain the high route. Google Earth\nshowed poor stability,\nwith easy initiation and high propagation potential. The avalanche course students and\ninstructors identified \u201cconsiderable\u201d avalanche danger on all aspects above treeline.\n    The mountaineering course students and instructors had read and discussed\nthe forecast and had identified avalanche conditions as the main hazard in a pre-\ntrip meeting on Thursday. The class made a decision to mitigate this hazard by avoid-\ning avalanche terrain until extensive observations and snowpack assessment were\npossible. The route the students planned to follow during the approach would keep\nthe group almost completely out of avalanche terrain, and they chose a camp loca-\ntion that provided access to representative terrain for snowpack assessment.\n    The group got to the trailhead at 8:30 a.m. It was about 24\u00b0F. The temperatures\nhad been in the 20s and 30s and clear, with 5\u201315 mph winds, since the storm the\nweek before. After a quick trailhead talk and beacon check, the group headed out.\nEveryone was wearing a working beacon and a helmet. Everyone also had a shovel\nand a probe along with their camping and climbing gear. Throughout the course,\nwe had done 12\u201315 hours of avalanche education, which included work in the class-\nroom and in the field. Two of the instructors had their Avy 2 certifications, and\nthree of the other members of the group had taken Avy 1 prior to the class.\n    During the approach, navigation was left to the students, and it proved to be\nchallenging and time consuming. The group strayed off the trail along the moraine\nbench on the south side of the Canwell Glacier and ended up out on the glacier.\nThe instructor let the students go the less efficient way to reinforce the lessons of\nroute-finding and navigation that had been taught in the course. We had proceed-\ned about 1.5 miles along the glacier before the students realized they wanted to be\n                                                on the large, flat moraine bench about\n                                               200 feet above them. The group gath-\n                                               ered and briefly discussed the options,\n                                               which were to retreat 1.5 miles to the\n                                               find the spot that the group had head-\n                                               ed out onto the glacier and then travel\n                                               back along the trail, or else to find the\n                                               best spot along the north-facing lateral\n                                               moraine feature to climb up to the flats\n                                               and trail above them. The group decid-\n                                               ed to find a way up the relatively short\n                                               moraine slope in front of them instead\n                                               of backtracking.\n                                                   While grouped up, we also dis-\nSlab avalanche set off by climbers ascending\ntoward the obvious moraine bench above.        cussed the snowpack observations we\n                                               had made so far that day. No one in the\ngroup had seen or heard any red flags up to that point. The folks in the lead chose\na line that followed a snow ramp up along a shallow rock band on a 25\u201330\u00b0 slope\nmost of the way up the moraine feature. This line had one short section (40\u201350\nfeet) of 35\u201340\u00b0 open snow slope at the top before reaching flat ground. Upon\nreaching this slope, the lead group strapped their skis on their packs and started\nup. The rest of the group went up the slope in a staggered line. For the first half of\nthe slope, the snow consisted of 30cm of unconsolidated sugar over scree. About\nhalfway up, the snow began to have a wind crust/slab that thickened toward the\nrollover from the flats above.\n    The lead people were about 20 feet from the flats above, and the last folks were\nabout 100 feet below them, when the lead climber triggered a wind slab that en-\ntrained all 13 members of the climbing party. The two people in the lead only trav-\neled a short distance downslope; five people were carried downslope but remained\non top; four people were partially buried; and two people were completely buried\nclose to the surface. The avalanche had an R3 relative size and a D2 destructive\nforce. The crown was between 6 and 12 inches thick. The slide path was 150 feet wide\nat the top and 250 feet wide at the bottom, with 250-foot vertical fall.\n    After the slide, rescue was initiated by several of the unburied students. One\nstudent took lead and did a count, one student yelled to everyone to turn their bea-\ncons to search, and two other students began looking for clues and limbs sticking\nout of the snow. (This student-led rescue was necessary due to the fact that all of the\ninstructors were either at the top of the slope or partially/fully buried.) Only one per-\nson was not accounted for right away\u2014miraculous with 13 people involved in the slide.\nAfter a few seconds, this victim\u2019s fingers poked through the snow and were noticed by\none of the students, who cleared the person\u2019s airway. Within 30 seconds, this person\nand all the others were being helped out of the snow. Two folks had minor breathing\ndifficulties after their burial. Other noncritical injuries included a small leg lacera-\ntion on one of the students, a small facial laceration from one student\u2019s sunglasses,\nand a minor hand laceration on one of the volunteer instructors. Several of the folks\nwere cold from being buried and were given dry clothes and warmed up. After a brief\ndiscussion, the group packed up and skied several hours back to the vehicles.\n\n ANALYSIS\nOur group was extremely lucky that no one was seriously hurt or killed in this\navalanche. The dangerous avalanche conditions persisted for the next couple of\nweeks. During that spring season, several human-triggered avalanches resulted in\ntwo fatalities within a few miles of our avalanche scene.\n    Here is a brief overview of some of the mistakes we made, contributing to our ac-\ncident, along with strategies that we could have used to help mitigate the avalanche\nrisks that we faced on our trip. This analysis is a combination of personal/in-house\nanalysis in addition to a third-party assessment of the avalanche accident.\n (1) Poor decision-making and communication as a group. The group didn\u2019t ac-\n     knowledge a distinct terrain change (entering avalanche terrain for the first\n     time that day) by grouping up and discussing all available options. We didn\u2019t\n     follow the STOP rule: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan and Pre-Mortem. We didn\u2019t\n     keep everyone informed and involved in the decision to get onto that particu-\n     lar slope. We didn\u2019t use a clear system for communication and decision-making.\n (2) Poor group management\u2014putting everyone on the same slope. We should have\n     exposed only a minimum number of people to a hazard at one time.\n (3) Not being flexible enough with the trip plan. We knew about the \u201cconsiderable\u201d\n     avalanche risk and hoped to use terrain for protection instead of reconsider-\n     ing the objective or changing the dates of the trip.\n (4) Avalanche blindness. Had we been more sensitive to the hazard, we could have\n     paused to acquire more information and/or backtracked to stay out of ava-\n     lanche terrain completely.\n (5) Time constraints, feeling rushed. We should have had more flexible time-man-\n     agement plans. (Source: Lead instructor of the class.)",

Shasta Mountain Guides owner/operator\nChris Carr and local physician Dr. Sean Malee were on the scene and handled patient\ncare. Dr. Malee\u2019s report follows.\n    As the climb doc for the Breast Cancer Fund Climb Against the Odds, I was\nwaiting on the summit for the last rope team of our group, led by Shasta Moun-\ntain Guides. Senior guide Rich Meyer observed an independent climber fall off the\nsouth side of the summit pinnacle. He fell approximately 25 feet vertically over\nrime-covered rock, then tumbled another 100 feet down firm, icy snow, coming to\na rest on the summit plateau.\n    I descended on skis to reach the climber, who was one of several leaders of a\nlarge group of Boy Scouts that had ascended the east side of Mt. Shasta on a multi-\nday climb. I immediately made an assessment. The patient was complaining of a\nbroken left arm and had no memory of the events after summiting. His head was\ncovered with abrasions and blood, with a small laceration over his left eye. He also\ncomplained of back pain on his right side.\n    I dug out a level area and moved the patient to a stable position. Using emer-\ngency Mylar blankets and a bivy sack, as well as scavenged garments from oth-\ner climbers, we insulated him from the snow to prevent hypothermia. Over the\nthree-hour rescue we were blessed with warm sunshine, light winds, and ambient\ntemperatures of around 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0F. Lead climbing ranger Nick Meyers eventually\nnotified me that California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter H-14 was on the way.\nDuring the three hours we waited, the injured climber remained alert and oriented,\nwith good vitals and warm extremities.\n    Near the limits of the CHP helicopter\u2019s altitude capabilities, the pilot made a he-\nroic, full-power landing on the south side of the summit plateau, at approximately\n 13,800 feet, at 3 p.m. The rescuers carried the patient by his clothing and moved\nhim into the helicopter behind the pilot\u2019s seat as quickly as possible. The pilot was\nable to lift off and descend directly to the hospital for definitive care. The patient\u2019s\ninjuries included multiple spinal fractures, distal left forearm fracture, multiple rib\nfractures, pneumothorax, a traumatic liver injury, and abrasions to the head. Last\nword was that he was in stable condition and expected to make a good recovery.\n\nANALYSIS\nI attributed the fall to fatigue, inexperience, and a lack of focus, given the exposed\nposition he was in. (More concerning was the lack of preparation of the patient\u2019s\nentire group, given that the majority of them were youths and few to none were\nwearing helmets or carrying packs, many were clad all in cotton, and few had any\nspare layers of insulation.) Without the help of the experienced mountain guide\nwho happened to be on scene and the pilot\u2019s \u201cdicey\u201d landing, the climber likely\nwould have not survived the ordeal.

From his location at about 12,000\nfeet, Bridgefs called 911. Mike Burns from Siskiyou County Search and Res-\ncue called climbing ranger Matt Dooley at 3:15 p.m. to explain the situation.\nHe said Bridgefs had complained of arm pain and had reported that he was\nunable to move.\n    At approximately 4:15 p.m., a California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter be-\ngan flying over the area. CHP soon located the injured Bridgefs, but due to\nwarm temperatures limiting the helicopter\u2019s capabilities at higher elevations,\nthey were unable to reach his location and pick him up. The helicopter landed\nin the Bunny Flat parking lot, and the pilot, Burns, and Dooley discussed their\noptions. It would take a minimum of two hours to hike to the patient\u2019s location\nfrom Helen Lake. Twelve- to 18-inch-deep sun cups in the snow would limit\nthe effectiveness of a lowering the climber in a sked (rescue stretcher), and the\nrisk of rockfall to rescuers and the climber would be greater during the after-\nnoon and evening. The CHP helicopter might be unable to reach Bridgefs before\ndarkness. However, the helicopter would be able to make an extraction attempt\nearly the next morning, if needed.\n    At approximately 4:45 p.m., Dooley and Burns consulted with Bridgefs by phone.\nBridgefs was informed of the difficulties preventing a rescue that day and advised\nto do his best to keep descending on his own, despite pain that he reported was\npreventing him from taking more than a few steps at a time. His brother, Robert,\nwould accompany him. The rescuers made plans for a morning mission if the pa-\ntient was unable to self-rescue during the night.\n    At about 10 p.m., the injured Bridgefs arrived at Helen Lake and called Burns,\nwho advised him to keep descending if he could. The patient reached the road at\napproximately 3 a.m. and soon checked in at Mercy Medical Center.\n ANALYSIS\nThis incident is documented mainly to highlight the fact that self-rescue some-\ntimes may be the only option after an accident. Poor weather, darkness, and other\nfactors may prevent a rescue team from reaching a patient. As a result, climbers\non Shasta and other mountains must be prepared either to wait through the night\nfor help to arrive (having carried appropriate clothing, shelter, food, water, first-aid\nand painkillers) or else be equipped and mentally prepared to self-evacuate.

At noon, Burns received a call from a party who had downclimbed to the injured\nclimber and stated that the climber was unconscious but breathing. At 12:30 p.m., the\nreporting party called back and said the injured climber might have stopped breathing.\n    The CHP helicopter H-24 landed at the Bunny Flat rescue cache at 1 p.m. and\nconfigured for lowering SAR members to the scene. However, winds prevented\nthis operation. At 1:55 p.m., the Air National Guard\u2019s Spartan 630 arrived at Bunny\nFlat and successfully performed a hoist. The injured climber was transported to\nMercy Medical Center in Mt. Shasta, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis climbing party was a father and son team. The father, 53, had some mountain-\neering experience, but the teenage son had never climbed. Other climbers on the\nmountain described the father and son ascending left of the Heart and attempting\na much more difficult and dangerous route than usual through the Red Banks. The\nthin, icy gullies or chimneys through very loose pumice on the left side of the Red\nBanks are rarely climbed, and for good reason. The son was able to climb one of the\nice chimneys, and he waited at the top for his father. As the older man was reach-\ning the top of the chimney, the son heard his dad yell and saw him fall through the\nchimney and slide approximately 500 feet before coming to rest.\n    These two climbers were inexperienced and off route. The easier routes around\nthe right side of the Red Banks formation are easily viewed from below, so it is\nunknown why these climbers chose to attempt the loose and more technical ice\nchimney.

        "Incident_Type": "GROUND FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Cams Pulled Out\nSouth Lake Tahoe, Pie Shop\nMy wife and I were climbing at Pie Shop, a granite crag in South Lake Tahoe where\nwe had been multiple times. I was leading the first pitch of True Grip, a right-\nangling 5.10b finger crack. While I am an experienced trad leader and have com-\nfortably climbed many routes at this grade, my finger-crack skills were a known\nweakness. Nonetheless, the protection potential was better on this climb than on two\n5.10 climbs I had just top-roped, and I assessed it as sufficiently safe to lead.\n    I fell off while attempting the opening moves, and my wife (belayer) spotted\nmy fall. I quickly got back on the climb and worked my way up to the first solid\nfinger lock and put in a blue TCU; I didn\u2019t use a quickdraw since I was close to the\nground. I moved up the climb, ultimately placing three more pieces: blue and gray\nTCUs without draws, then a gray TCU with an alpine draw. (Editor\u2019s note: The gray\n00 Metolius TCU is the second-smallest in the TCU line. The blue number 1 TCU is\ndesigned for half-inch to two-thirds-inch cracks.) I inspected and pull-tested all the\nplacements and believed they were sound. However, I was shaky on the lead, un-\nable to find good rest positions and not confident in my feet.\n    As I moved above my last piece of protection, I saw a decent foothold on my\nleft, one move higher, so I stepped up and tried to get to a rest position. However,\nI was unable to secure good finger locks and I believe my foot slipped. I was about\na body length above my last piece of protection (the gray TCU) and approximately\n25 feet up the wall.\n    As I fell, three pieces of protection pulled (the first, third, and fourth) and I hit\nthe ground. The majority of the blow in striking the ground was absorbed on the\nleft side of my lower and middle back, which impacted a manzanita stump. The\nwind was knocked out of me. After my breathing returned to normal, my wife and I\ndid a high-level injury assessment: My back and rib cage hurt where I hit the stump\nbut were not exceedingly painful; my left wrist was sore; and I had a handful of\nsmall abrasions. After determining that I did not appear to have any head or spine\ninjuries or puncture wounds, my wife helped me up and packed our gear, and we\nslowly hiked out to the car and drove to the ER.\n     I was diagnosed with four transverse process fractures of the vertebrae, two\nbroken ribs, and a minor collapse of the left lung. A month later, an MRI revealed\nthat I also had suffered a broken left wrist. Fortunately, all injuries have fully healed\nand I have returned to climbing. And I am working on my finger-crack technique.\n\n ANALYSIS\nThe fall happened very quickly, but the gear that pulled may have absorbed some\nof the energy of the fall, or else I believe that I would have been more seriously in-\njured. The top TCU was substantially deformed, and the metal lobes of each of the\nTCUs that pulled showed significant shearing where they had been in contact with\nthe rock. There were no issues with the rope or belay. Overall, the force of the fall\nwas just too great for the size and quantity of protection. With smaller gear, there\nis much less margin for error. Just slight walking of a small cam can greatly reduce\nthe force it may hold. My key takeaway is to place protection more often when using\nsmall gear, doubling up on the really small pro and/or adding big gear soon afterward,\nif possible. Finally, knowing that finger-crack technique was a weakness, I should have\napproached this route as a project versus an onsight. (Source: Tim Maly.)",

Mark and Aaron had cell phones but initially could not get service;\neventually Aaron managed to call 911, which patched him through to YOSAR.\n    On the ledge, the party\u2019s main concern was to control bleeding from Pete\u2019s left\narm, which appeared to have suffered a severe, open fracture of the humerus. Initial\nattempts at direct pressure failed to stop the hemorrhaging, so the team attempted\nto tourniquet Pete\u2019s arm, first with a shirt and then with a sling.

The locking carabiner clipped rived at the base. They informed the\nto the yellow slings (connecting the haul bag to the climbers that a technical team and\nrappel carabiner) is believed to have unclipped in the advanced life support was en route,\nYosemite incident. Including the haul bag connection\n                                                       but it would likely take at least an\n(not shown), this setup used seven carabiners. [Right]\nA much simpler setup with a doubled cordelette to hour for them to get into position\nconnect the rappel device to both the climber and and complete a rescue lower. With\nthe haul bag (gray slings), using only two carabiners. this information, the group decided\n to stabilize Pete\u2019s arm as best they could, using shirts, hiking poles, and materials from\nAaron\u2019s first-aid kit, and rappel with Pete to the ground to meet the rescue team.\n    After packaging Pete\u2019s arm, Jeff rigged for a tandem rappel using a modified\nversion of a rescue spider, a rappel configuration that allowed Jeff to rappel down\nthe line along with Pete, carrying Pete\u2019s weight on the rappel device. (It should be\nnoted that this was essentially the same method Jeff had used to rappel with the\nhaul bag that dropped; with various iterations, it is a common way to rappel with a\nheavy load.) As Jeff and Pete reached the base, the full rescue team arrived. YOSAR\nparamedics assessed Pete and repackaged his arm. After an initial attempt at an\nassisted walkout, it was decided to package Pete into a litter and carry him down\nthe trail. He was flown in a medical helicopter from El Cap Meadow.\n\nANALYSIS\nJeff had been rappelling with an ATC extended from his harness on two Purcell\nprusiks. These were each clipped separately to a locking carabiner (the master-\npoint) that was holding his rappel device. His rappel was backed up by a prusik\nhitch on the rope below his ATC.\n    To carry the haul bag, Jeff had clipped another locking carabiner to the master\npoint, clipped a sling to this, and clipped the sling to the haul bag. He clipped a\nsecond sling from the haul bag directly to the same locker that was clipped to the\nmasterpoint. (See photo at left.) Each sling was attached at the haul bag with an\nindividual non-locking carabiner, and the two were opposite and opposed.\n    While some specifics were lost in the chaos or simply could not be recalled, it\nis known that, while Jeff was rappelling, the haul bag caught on a small ledge. This\ncaused the slings holding the bag to go slack temporarily. When the bag released\nfrom the ledge, it somehow unclipped from the masterpoint and dropped.\n    Although no one in either team was 100 percent sure, they are fairly certain\nthat when the bag landed on Little John, both runners were attached to the haul\nbag. This would mean the failure point was at the locking carabiner clipped into the\nmasterpoint. Jeff believes the locker that was holding the two runners going to his\nhaul bag opened and simultaneously released the two attachment points. Whether\nhe failed to lock it before starting down or it unlocked during the rappel due to\nvibration and improper orientation is unknown.\n    The fact that multiple people involved in this incident had medical training\nand/or self-rescue knowledge was critical to saving Pete\u2019s arm and his life.\n    Other takeaways from this incident:\n     \u2022 Always check that your locking carabiners are locked, and periodically dou-\n       ble-check that they\u2019ve stayed locked.\n     \u2022 Although Jeff\u2019s basic system for rappelling with the haul bag was properly\n       configured, there are simpler ways to rig this rappel. The number of cara-\n       biners in Jeff\u2019s rigging may have contributed to a failure to recognize the\n       unlocked carabiner. Simplicity is an element of safe climbing systems.\n     \u2022 Be constantly aware of your surroundings while climbing. Parties climbing\n       and rappelling above you are always a cause for concern.\n     \u2022 Yelling \u201cROCK!\u201d loudly and repeatedly is the best way to get the attention of\n       people below. The climbers could have been momentarily confused by the\n       yelled words \u201chaul bag.\u201d (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

        "Details_Factors": "No Backups\nYosemite Valley, Reed\u2019s Pinnacle\nThe names of the climbers in this report have been changed. On July 10, at 2:50 p.m.,\nYosemite Dispatch received a call regarding a climber fall with injuries at Reed\u2019s Pinna-\ncle. The initial reports came in as a male climber with a broken leg. Upon arrival at the\nparking area, the first responding ranger found an adult male, John, 33, with an angu-\nlated lower leg/ankle fracture. John told the ranger that his partner David, age 41, was\nstill at the base of the cliff and had been in and out of consciousness after a long fall.\n     The park ranger ran up the approach trail to the base of the cliff with a medic\nbag. Upon reaching the cliff, he found David unresponsive, without a pulse, and\nnot breathing. He immediately called for additional resources and began CPR. Af-\nter updates and communication with the park\u2019s Medical Control, the patient was\npronounced dead at approximately 3:55 p.m.\n     Numerous interviews with the surviving climber and post-accident analysis by the\nresponding ranger revealed some details of what had happened. Before the accident,\nthe two climbers had climbed Lunatic Fringe, a popular 5.10c single-pitch route. After\nleading, John remained at the anchor at the top of the climb to belay David up. The two\nclimbers then decided to simul-rappel, with each climber rappelling one strand of the\nrappel rope, so that each climber would counterweight the other. David used a Petzl\nGrigri, while John used a Black Diamond ATC device. They were using an 80-meter\nrope, both ends of which reached the ground from this anchor, but without any extra.\n     During the rappel, John was beneath David and remembers David stopping or\nslowing down at some point. John reached a small, sloping ledge about 15 feet\n                                                 above the ground and waited for Da-\n                                                 vid to catch up with him. According to\n                                                 the post-accident analysis, David was\n                                                 roughly 70 feet off the ground at this\n                                                 point. John felt a sudden change in the\n                                                 pull of the rope and the rope \u201cgoing,\u201d\n                                                 and he started to fall. He briefly lost\n                                                 consciousness, and when he came to\n                                                 he saw David on the ground near him.\n                                                 John asked David if he was OK and re-\n                                                 membered David briefly responding.\n                                                 John told David that he would go get\n                                                 help. When he tried to stand, he re-\n                                                 alized his leg was broken, and so he\n                                                 crawled down the short approach. At\n                                                 the Reed\u2019s parking area, he found visi-\n                                                 tors who were able to call 911, activat-\n                                                 ing Yosemite\u2019s emergency response.\n\n                                                   ANALYSIS\n                                                   From a follow-up investigation, it is be-\n                                                   lieved David fell approximately 70 feet\nRelative positions of the two climbers in a Reed\u2019s after the end of the rope on John\u2019s side\nPinnacle simul-climbing accident. NPS Diagram      passed through John\u2019s ATC rappel de-\n vice. This was determined based on the amount of rope left beneath David\u2019s Grigri\nas well as other observations. There were no knots or backup systems on the rope.\n    A fixed nut was observed in the crack near the point where David fell, and one\npossible explanation is that David paused to attempt to remove this piece of equip-\nment. If David had pulled onto a stance momentarily, unweighting his side of the rope,\nJohn would have felt himself suddenly drop (as he stated consistently). It\u2019s possible this\ncaused John to lose control of his side of the rappel rope. Without a hands-free backup\nhitch (e.g., autoblock), he would not have been able to regain control of the rope as it\nrapidly passed through his belay device, causing both men to fall to the ground.\n    Simul-rappelling is an advanced technique that is rarely required by the aver-\nage climber. While simul-rappelling, both climber\u2019s lives are placed at risk by any\nmistakes. [Editor\u2019s note: Two climbers were seriously injured in another simul-rap-\npelling accident, in the Shawangunks in New York, in 2016.]\n    John stated that one reason they decided to simul-rappel was that David had\na Grigri, which can only be used to rappel a single strand of rope. To avoid the\nrisk incurred by simul-rappelling, John and David could have tied the rope to the\nanchor, allowing David to rappel the fixed rope on his Grigri. John then could have\nuntied the fixed rope and rappelled with his ATC as usual. (Controlling a rappel\nwith an ATC is patently safer with two strands of rope as opposed to one.) More-\nover, David reportedly had climbed the route before and knew the climbers could\nrappel the route with a single 80-meter rope. Knowing this, David could have low-\nered John to the ground after he led the pitch, and then John could have belayed\nDavid on a top-rope as he seconded the route.\n    In the special circumstances that simul-rappelling is preferred, good communi-\ncation is essential. The excessive distance (about 50 feet) between the two climb-\ners perhaps inhibited David from expressing to John that he planned to slow or\nstop his rappel. If John had been nearer to David, he may have had the opportunity\nto anticipate the momentary weight shift and not lose control of his device.\n    One or more backup systems could have prevented this accident. Stopper knots\nin the ends of the rope would have prevented the rope from passing through John\u2019s\nrappel device. A \u201chands-free\u201d backup, such as a friction hitch, also might have pre-\nvented the catastrophic loss of control. Finally, the two climbers could have linked\nthemselves with a tether, in effect closing the system until they both reached the\nground. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Attempted to Rappel Unanchored Rope\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, East Ledges Descent\nChristopher Vale and his partner Luke started climbing the west face of El Capitan\naround 7:30 a.m. on September 5. (The name of Vale\u2019s climbing partner has been\nchanged.) The two had met a few days earlier and climbed the Steck-Salath\u00e9 on\nSentinel Rock as a warmup for El Capitan. They finished the west face on El Cap\nat around 7 p.m. After topping out, Vale was in a hurry to get back down. (He had\nplans to go back up on El Capitan the next day to work on Free Rider.) By 8 p.m., the\ntwo climbers had descended to the top of the East Ledges rappels.\n    Vale reached the rappels first and began descending while Luke was still a little\nways behind. At the time of their descent, other climbers had left ropes in place\n for the four rappels. When Luke reached the rappels, he could see Vale\u2019s headlamp\ndescending below. Luke heard Vale yell \u201coff rappel.\u201d Approximately eight seconds\nlater, Luke heard crashing and saw that Vale\u2019s headlamp had disappeared. Luke\nrecognized that his partner had taken a large fall and tried to establish commu-\nnication with him. Unable to get a response, Luke called 911 to activate a rescue.\n    Yosemite Search and Rescue dispatched a hasty team up the trail to make contact\nwith the party. Upon arrival at the bottom of the East Ledges rappels, the SAR team\nfound the patient showing no signs of life. After consultation with Park Medical Con-\ntrol, the climber was declared deceased.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe East Ledges rappel route descends a vertical cliff approximately 500 feet high.\nMost climbing teams complete this descent with rappels via bolted anchors. Mul-\ntiple trees exist on the cliff between the bolted anchors.\n    Before Vale\u2019s fall, ropes had been fixed along the rappel route. These fixed ropes\nwere of unknown origin but were being used regularly by climbers to expedite\ntheir descent and for ascending to the top of the wall to access routes from above.\nClimbers who had descended the East Ledges in the days prior to Vale\u2019s fall said they\nhad seen a blue rope hanging adjacent to the standard rappel route and stuck in a flake\nand tree. In daylight, the climbers said, it was obvious that this rope was \u201cgarbage\u201d and\nwas not safe to use, but this fact must not have been easily observed at night.\n    When YOSAR arrived on scene, they observed a blue rope rigged through Vale\u2019s\nATC rappel device. While it is impossible to know the exact sequence of events that\npreceded Vale\u2019s fall, it is likely that he arrived at a ledge between the first and second\nanchors from the top, saw the blue rope in the tree to his right, and considered it to\nbe the next rappel line. He removed his ATC from the first line, called \u201coff rappel\u201d to\nhis partner above, and rigged his ATC onto the blue rope. At some point while he was\nweighting the blue line, the rope dislodged and Vale fell to the base of the rappels.\n    Avoid rappelling or ascending ropes unless the condition and security of the rope,\nincluding its anchor, is known. In the dark and in a hurry, it is reasonable to assume\nthat Vale didn\u2019t inspect the blue line before committing his life to it.\n    Always test a new critical connection before undoing your previous connection.\nFor example, after loading your rappel device, you should test-weight the rope\nwhile still connected to a trusted anchor.\n    Slow down. Check that your anchor is secure, your carabiners are locked, and\nthat your device is loaded correctly before each rappel. No amount of time saved\nis worth skipping these steps.\n    The climb is not over until you\u2019re on the ground. Of the six climbing-related\nfatalities in Yosemite over the last two years, all have been related to rappelling\nand descending. Stay vigilant until you are completely done with your adventure.\n(Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

On October 7, Mike\nand Dylan started up the South Face (5.8 C1) of Washington Column. The two had\n done a little climbing together, but never\nin Yosemite Valley and mostly on single-\npitch climbs. Mike was the more experi-\nenced of the two, having done a number of\nYosemite big-wall climbs, including routes\non El Capitan. Dylan was newer to climb-\ning, having started about one year before.\n    The team hiked their gear to the base\nof the route and started climbing in late\nmorning. At the top of pitch one is a large\nledge. Mike started up pitch two, a pin-\nscarred corner rated C1. Approximately\n35 feet up, the piece Mike was standing\non pulled out. Dylan and Mike believe he\npulled out an additional three pieces of\ngear during his fall, before landing on the\nbelay ledge on his right side.\n    When he tried to move, Mike experi-\nenced excruciating pain on his side and was\nhaving trouble breathing. The two realized\nthat moving Mike on their own was likely\nimpossible and they called 911.

After a reconnaissance flight of the area, a ranger\nwas inserted onto the ledge at about 5 p.m. and extracted Mike in the litter. Dylan\ndescended with the SAR team. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nANALYSIS\nFirst climbed in 1964, the crack systems of the South Face Route were heavily\nscarred by repeated piton placements. The typically shallow and flaring nature of\nthese features can make protection in them less secure and harder to gauge than a\nnormal crack placement. Seeing the inverted lobes on the first cam that pulled out,\nour best guess is that the cam failed because it was either under-cammed (piece\ntoo small for the placement) or placed in a flare.\n    Although it\u2019s impossible to know for sure, we also speculate that Mike placed\nthe cam straight in as opposed to angling downward in the direction of the antici-\npated pull, because only two lobes of the cam were damaged. A cam placed straight\nin will distribute a disproportionate amount of force to the upper lobes, in this case\npossibly resulting in their failure.\n    In overhanging terrain, Mike\u2019s fall might have ended up fine.

About 10 feet below\nhe hit a ledge, resulting in the ankle injury, then fell about 15 feet farther before his\nrope arrested him.\n    A team climbing above saw the accident, fixed their ropes, rappelled down, and\nassisted the leader as his partner lowered him to the first big ledge they could\nreach.

Both have spent decades climbing in the Sierra. (Their names have been changed\nhere.) The day had started out with clear blue skies, and both climbers felt that the\nweather report promised stable enough conditions to proceed with the climb.\n     After the initial steep pitches, the team began to simul-climb through easier\nterrain on the ridge traverse. As they were climbing, clouds started to form. Quick-\nly, the weather worsened to hail and lightning, prompting them to rappel from the\nridge.\n     The first three rappels went well. The team found in-place anchors from previ-\nous teams and backed up the rappels with extra gear when necessary. At the fourth\nrappel Will went first. He saw an anchor far to one side but felt the slick rock would\nmake it a difficult and risky rappel. Instead he rappelled down an angled corner to\nreach a stance and build his own rappel anchor. Will called \u201coff rappel\u201d and James\nbegan to rappel. He started straight down and then tried to tension over to the be-\nlay when he was even with Will. Before he could reach the anchor, James lost con-\ntrol of his footing and pendulumed \u201capproximately 30 feet.\u201d He sustained traumatic\ninjuries to both legs while swinging horizontally across the low-angle terrain.\n                                                          James threw the ends of his\n                                                     rappel ropes to Will, who then\n                                                     pulled him over to the anchor.\n                                                     With James in extreme pain and\n                                                     unable to function at full capacity,\n                                                     Will lowered James to the ground\n                                                     and then rappelled to the base\n                                                     himself.\n                                                         The two were getting wet,\n                                                     and temperatures were dropping.\n                                                     With no phone reception to call\n                                                     for help, they decided to send Will\n                                                     out to the front country to seek\n                                                     a rescue.

James cut the bottom out of a back-\npack and slipped it over his legs to create an extra layer of protection from the\nelements. Will then jogged approximately five miles to the road and went directly\nto the Tuolumne SAR site, at about 8 p.m., to initiate a rescue.\n    Using GPS coordinates from his phone, Will was able to give the SAR team\nJames\u2019 precise location. YOSAR sent a hasty team, including a registered nurse and\na paramedic, to care for James until the helicopter could arrive with first light the\nnext morning.\n\nANALYSIS\nBeing prepared for sudden changes in the weather is essential in the High Sierra.\nAlthough James\u2019 fractured heels were his only injuries, the potential for hypother-\nmia was very real. Temperatures that night were in the low 30s (F). James wore\nonly a long-sleeve fleece, but Will had carried a Gore-Tex jacket that may have\nprevented James from becoming hypothermic. Their clever improvisation of turn-\ning a backpack into a bivy sack was also important for maintaining James\u2019 warmth.\n    One way to avoid James\u2019 swinging fall would have been for Will to fix the rap-\npel lines to the lower anchor after anchoring himself. James then could have rap-\npelled more directly to the belay. Fixing the ropes at the lower anchor also acts as\na backup for the second person\u2014a good practice even on straight-down rappels.\n    James and Will both were using hands-free backups while rappelling. If James\nhad let go of the rope during his fall or hit his head and been knocked out, his\nprusik would have arrested a catastrophic fall. Backups are especially important\nin a forced retreat like this, when contending with the extra hazards of rain, chill,\nloose rock, and haste.

There are several variations, but all of\nenced the climbers\u2019 decisions to climb them tie off the coils to the belay loop.\nunroped through relatively easy terrain.\n   Long alpine ridges frequently require altnernating between a number of tech-\nniques, including climbing unroped, simul-climbing, and belaying individual pitches.\nThere are risks with each approach, and climbers must balance the relative safety of\neach versus the pressures of time and weather as they move up a route. Shorten-\ning the rope with a \u201cKiwi coil\u201d (see photo) can allow climbers to move together over\ncomplex terrain and still place intermediate protection or use natural features for\nprotection against a catastrophic fall, without creating excess rope drag or rockfall\ndanger. Some trip reports indicate the final section of Bear Creek Spire\u2019s east ridge\ncan be climbed using a \u201cpicket fence\u201d method to weave the rope among natural rock\nfeatures, protecting to a degree.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled Out\nEldorado Canyon, West Ridge\nMarch 5 was a beautiful, sunny day in Eldo and I decided that after a good warmup\nI would put in a few burns on my project: Foxtrot (5.11d PG-13). I had top-roped this\nclimb several times, doing it clean once.\n    I got up to the rest section just below a small roof and placed a yellow Metolius\nTCU (approximately 3/4-inch piece) in a seam. Above that piece is the crux of the\nroute, and the next opportunity for gear is a tricky placement with a green Alien,\nfollowed by a seam higher up that takes small nuts. After a rest, I climbed up to the\nlast move of the crux, a tricky layback or a long deadpoint to a positive flat edge.\n                              I didn\u2019t have a green Alien (and I didn\u2019t know about\n                             that placement yet anyway), so I tried to deadpoint\n                             for the big edge but came up an inch short. The yel-\n                             low TCU that I\u2019d placed at the roof held my fall, which\n                             was clean and not too jarring.\n                                 I pulled up for another attempt and tried the same\n                             move with a little more umph but fell a second time.\n                             The piece held again. I looked over the placement and\n                             it seemed fine, so I decided to try again. I threw to the\n                             final hold and latched for a split second, cutting feet\n                             and swinging out from the wall Air Jordan\u2013style. But\n                             then I slipped again and sailed through the air. This\n                             time the yellow TCU pulled out of the crack and I kept\n                             falling. My next piece was four to five feet below: an\n                             orange Metolius Master Cam placed in a good con-\n                             striction.

Adam Brink                 ANALYSIS\n                                 The biggest mistake I made was not readjusting the\ncam into its ideal spot after taking the first fall. I just assumed that because the piece\nheld a fall it must be solid. The crack is a bit shallow and downward-facing, since it\nis in a small roof, and the cam may have been sliding a small amount out of its ideal\nposition in each fall, until it was close enough to the outside that it popped out.\n    The second big mistake I made was that I trusted just one piece of gear to\ncatch my fall, and I didn\u2019t consider the consequences of the piece pulling out. Had\nI placed another piece adjacent to the one that pulled, or at least closer to my\nsecond-highest piece of pro, the ledge fall could have been prevented.\n    Finally, my familiarity with the route had led me to believe it was safe enough\nfor me to project the climb on lead before I had every move and placement dialed.\nI obviously was not solid on the crux, and had I not fallen at all I would have been\ncompletely safe. My hard-man attitude about leading and taking falls got in the\nway of good risk assessment. (Source: Mike Minson.)\n\n\n\n\nGROUND FALL BEFORE REACHING FIRST PIECE\nEldorado Canyon, Roof Routes\nKurt Ross was belaying me (an experienced climber) on Guenese, a 5.11a trad route\nwith a few fixed pieces. I considered placing a 0.5 Camalot in an overlap before\nclipping a piton, the first fixed pro on the route, but I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m only 5 feet tall, and\nthe pin felt very far away. I backed down once or twice before working out the right\nsequence for a shorter person. As I made the stand-up move to the piton, I popped\noff the wall and struck the ramp below, having fallen 10 to 15 feet. Kurt rushed over\nand asked me not to move, for fear of spinal injury. Luckily, there was none. I suf-\nfered a stress fracture of the cuboid (a small tarsal bone on the outer aspect of the\nfoot), and I know I was lucky to have sustained only one injury.\n\nANALYSIS\nKurt had offered to clip the first piton for me, which, had I not been so prideful, could\nhave saved me from a ground fall. He stands 6-feet, 4-inches, and would have no problem\nreaching the pin. In addition, I absolutely should have placed that Camalot before the pin.\nPerhaps pride clouded my judgment there as well. (Source: Kathy Karlo.) Editor\u2019s note: Stick\nclips are rarely used in Eldorado Canyon, but they might prevent injuries like this. That said,\nfixed pitons should always be regarded with suspicion and should be backed up.\n\nINADEQUATE PLANNING FOR DESCENTS LEADS TO SERIOUS INJURIES: In\nseparate incidents, climbers in Clear Creek Canyon and Staunton State Park expe-\nrienced ground falls as they were attempting to descend from single-pitch climbs.\nOnly incomplete, third-person summaries of these accidents were available, but both\n\n                                                                             Colorado / 59\n stemmed from inadequate preparation for descents from fixed anchors. The Clear\nCreek case involved miscommunication between the belayer and the climber, leading\nto a ground fall from an anchor atop a 5.9 sport climb. The other originated when an\nattempt to descend from a 170-foot 5.7 traditional pitch with a single rope came up\nshort; after a second climber had scrambled up to a ledge to assist the stranded leader,\nshe fell while attempting to return to the ground.",

Nearing the\ncrux, a significant overhang split by a hand crack, the climber placed two pieces,\none of which was a cam with only two lobes engaged. Fearing she might pump out\non the crux above, she decided to rest by hanging from the rope clipped to the\nhigher of the two cams, which looked more solid. That piece pulled out, as did the\none below, and the climber fell 20 to 25 feet and sustained an ankle injury.

It was al-\nmost 8:30 p.m. on July 23 by the time we finished hiking around the park, but we\nfelt there was still enough time to sneak in a quick climb. One route seemed within\nour abilities: Potholes, a 5.7 route on a 60-foot sandstone spire, protected by two\nbolts and three pitons.

Duane\nRaleigh (age 56, with 43 years of experience) was leading the first pitch of the WI3+\nM4 route. Due to thin ice, the only protection he placed on the 230-foot pitch was\na stubby screw at approximately 75 feet. Raleigh reached the end of the rope with-\nout finding an anchor, so he asked his partner (40 years of experience) to take him\noff belay, so he could continue climbing and searching for an anchor.\n    Raleigh spotted a precarious stack of granite that he thought might be secure\nenough to sling for a rappel anchor. He tested the pile by hitting it with a tool and\nthen pulling on it. Although apprehensive about the anchor\u2019s stability, he had no\nbetter option, so he wrapped a 10-foot 6mm cord around the rocks and tied the\nends together with a flat figure-8 knot, visually checking and tugging the knot to\ntest it. He then clipped his rope to the cord with a carabiner, planning to down-\nclimb most of the route to minimize weighting the anchor.\n    Due to the steepness of the first 10 feet of this descent, Raleigh leaned back and\n                                                                    weighted the rope.

(Sources: Rock and Ice magazine and Duane Raleigh.)\n\nANALYSIS\nAlthough not verifiable by the climber, it is possible that the flat figure-8 may have\ncapsized under load, flipping and rolling down the cord until the knot reached\nthe ends of the cord and untied. Both the flat figure-8 and the flat overhand knot\nhave been used to join two rappel ropes, and both can capsize under heavy loads.\nHowever, a well-tied flat overhand is much less likely to do so and is strongly rec-\nommended over the flat figure-8, which accounts for most reported failures of this\ngeneral category of rappel knot.\n    When tying the flat overhand to join two rappel ropes, always tie a well-dressed\nknot and leave long tails (15 to 18 inches). Individually tighten all four strands of rope\nentering the knot. If using ropes of different diameters, age, or condition, or icy or wet\nropes, consider tying a second overhand immediately adjacent to the first as a backup,\nthough this will increase the bulk of the knot. Or, if there are no concerns about the\nknot snagging when the rappel ropes are pulled, consider the double fisherman\u2019s knot\nor Flemish bend, which are very reliable, albeit more difficult to untie after loading.\n    Do not use the flat overhand to join ropes permanently (e.g., tying a cordelette\nor tying a rope around a tree for an anchor). The double fisherman\u2019s knot is pre-\nferred for these purposes. Also, do not use the flat overhand for tying slings or\nwebbing. Use a water knot for slings that may be retied and a double fisherman\u2019s\nfor permanent knots. Again, dress all knots carefully and tighten every strand.\n(Sources: Rock and Ice magazine and the Editors.)",

While leading pitch two of the Sky-\nlight (WI4+), midway up the pitch, Remsberg stopped to place his third ice screw,\n about 10 feet above his previous screw. During this process, he coached the stu-\ndents and described why he was placing another screw relatively soon (the pre-\nvious placement had hit some air pockets and pro-\nduced some surface cracking). Before he completed\nthe third screw, Remsberg was hit by an unknown\nfalling object, possibly a snow mushroom. The be-\nlay stance for this pitch is down a snow slope and\naround a corner, making it difficult to maintain a be-\nlay with minimal slack. The resulting fall was around\n35 feet down an ice chimney. Remsberg\u2019s second ice\nscrew held, and the belay halted the fall just before\nhe hit an ice ledge at the start of the pitch.\n     With Remsberg still conscious, the well-trained\nstudents were able to self-rescue via a lower and\nthen tandem rappel to the road below the climb.\nMeanwhile, at the top of pitch one, Adams had\ncalled 911 and Remsberg called Nate Disser, the\n                                                       \u201cSOAP notes\u201d were compiled on the\nowner of San Juan Mountain Guides (SJMG).

Four days prior to this incident, temperatures on the mountain soared into\nthe mid-30s (F) for over 24 hours. Following this, the temperature dropped to near\n0\u00b0F. These conditions created a very hard and icy snowpack. Melt-freeze crusts\ncan often make self-arresting impossible.\n   It is important to assess snow conditions and combine this with an honest as-\nsessment of the experience of members of a party. Depending on the competence\nand risk tolerance of party members, even low-angle snow slopes may need to be\n belayed in order to assure safe passage. The conditions this day were far from ideal\nand required a greater measure of security for a team that included novice alpine\nclimbers. (Source: Mount Washington Avalanche Center.)\n\nMORE FALLS ON MT. WASHINGTON: On March 13, two long, sliding falls caused\nserious injuries on Mt. Washington. In the first, a skier fell about 1,000 feet in Hill-\nman\u2019s Highway and hit several rocks during his slide, requiring a helicopter evacu-\nation. Soon afterward, a hiker on the summit cone fell and broke his femur while\nglissading terrain the party had not ascended.

After the first\nfour or five pitches of most routes in this area of Cannon, the climbing tends to\npeter into brushy ledges punctuated by short slabs, and route-finding can become\ndifficult. By nighttime the pair was still climbing. Both climbers felt that retreat\nwasn\u2019t an option.

        "Details_Factors": "AVALANCHE\nMt. Washington, Tuckerman Ravine\nTwo climbers and three skiers were involved in an avalanche in Tuckerman Ravine\non Sunday, January 17. The two climbers, both from Canada, were ascending a gully\ncalled the Chute on the left side of the ravine. Four skiers and an avalanche class\nwere nearby at the time. Just before 1 p.m., the pair climbed over an old fracture\nline, a foot to a foot and a half high, and continued into softer snow. After ascend-\ning approximately 30 feet through deeper snow, the climber in front felt that the\nslope might be unstable and decided to turn around. As they turned to descend, the\nslope fractured about 75 to 100 feet above them and approximately 75 to 100 feet\nwide. The two climbers were carried most of the distance to the ravine floor. Three\nnearby skiers also were caught and carried varying distances by the debris.\n    One of the two climbers sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was treat-\ned and released by snow ranger staff and the Mt. Washington Volunteer Ski Patrol.\nOne of the skiers also received non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Mt. Washington Observatory reported 5.5 inches of snow on the summit dur-\ning the previous day, with around four inches falling at Hermit Lake at the base of\nTuckerman Ravine. Summit winds blew 40\u201360 mph overnight from the west. The\nwind diminished to 20 mph as visitors began to enter Tuckerman. An avalanche\nbulletin posted on Saturday morning had accurately described recent and upcom-\ning snowfall and wind loading in the area.\n    Although everyone involved in this incident was appropriately clothed for win-\nter conditions and some of the individuals were equipped and trained to apply first\naid to the injured, none of the five people caught in the avalanche was wearing\nbeacons or carrying avalanche rescue gear. Sadly, this is not unusual in our terrain.\nFrequently, climbers leave behind avalanche rescue gear to save weight, leaving no\n quick course of action should burial occur.\n    Given the clustering of users near the Chute, it seems safe to assume that the\n\u201csocial proof\u201d heuristic was at play. Following some discussion, the avalanche class\nchose to travel in steep terrain beneath a recently loaded slope. They were followed\nby the party of two climbers and the three skiers. Whether due to the easier travel\nfollowing in someone else\u2019s boot track, the erroneous assumption that a slope is\nsafe because someone else already has traveled it, or the belief that other travelers\nknow more than you, this behavior is all too common in Tuckerman Ravine.\n    Additional challenges exist when trying to rebalance risk on a continual basis,\nbased on the actions of others outside your control. Mt. Washington has very con-\ncentrated avalanche terrain and a high amount of visitation. Your party\u2019s move-\nments may be under tight control and stay within your chosen level of accepted risk,\nbut only in the absence of other, more unpredictable people. An associated concern\nis the challenge of spreading out to reduce overall risk in a relatively confined area.\n    The two climbers overlooked a red flag when they climbed over a recently re-\nloaded crown line and onto a slope that rises from 40\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 or more. Moreover, all\nparties involved in the Chute incident crossed beneath this slope within four hours\nof a period of active loading. While everyone chooses their own level of acceptable\nrisk, it is unclear whether all parties involved had sought the information needed\nto make an informed decision by reading the posted General Avalanche Bulletin or\nseeking recent weather data.

        "Details_Factors": "Clipped Wrong Rope Into Anchor\nDiablo Canyon, Sun Devil Wall\nOn January 18, at approximately 2 p.m., Climber 1 fell from the top anchors of pitch\ntwo of Appendicitis (5.10a) on the Sun Devil Wall. She fell approximately 170 feet to\nthe ground. Trained medical professionals were climbing nearby and immediately\nrendered aid, including CPR. An emergency medical helicopter was quickly called.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nDiablo Canyon, near Santa Fe, has multiple routes longer than 30 to 35 meters, and\nparties will frequently set up a long top-rope, using two ropes tied together, for\nothers to climb the route after one climber has led it. On the day of this accident,\nothers in this climbing party (Climber 2, Climber 3) led the route in two pitches and\nthen set up a two-rope system, using two slings and four locking carabiners at the\ntop anchor. The two ropes were of similar diameter and ample length, and were\njoined with a triple fisherman\u2019s knot. Climber 2 and Climber 3 then rappelled the\nroute in one double-rope rap.\n     The climbing party\u2019s procedure for top-roping on two ropes involved belaying\non the side of the joined ropes with the fisherman\u2019s knot. In order to avoid the need\nto pass the fisherman\u2019s knot when it reached the belay device, the climber would\ntie in short on the other strand of rope, clipping a figure 8 on a bight to a locking\ncarabiner clipped to the belay loop of his or her harness. Therefore, the climber\nhad a long tail of extra rope dangling while climbing. This top-rope setup was com-\nmon for the crag, and the climbing party was local. Others in the party top-roped\nthe route in the same manner on that day without incident.\n     The next climber on the route (Climber 4) carried steel carabiners to leave as\nfixed gear at the anchors, attaching them to existing chains on the two anchor\nbolts to facilitate anchor cleaning and lowering. Many routes in the area have fixed\ncarabiners for lowering, left by earlier climbers.\n     As the last person to top-rope the route for the day, Climber 1 agreed to clean\nthe anchors. She planned to transfer the rope from the slings and lockers at the\nanchor to the two new fixed carabiners and remove all the other gear. Climber 1\nthen would be lowered, which was communicated to the belayer (Climber 4) before\nstarting the climb.\n     Climber 1, age 59, had extensive personal experience with this method of top-\nroping and cleaning anchors. Her typical procedure would have been to (1) clip\ndirectly into both anchor bolts using a personal anchor system; (2) remove the\ntemporary anchor attachments, letting the rope hang from her harness attach-\nment point; (3) place the rope into the fixed carabiners for lowering; (4) check her\nsetup; and (5) remove her personal anchor system to be lowered. On this occasion,\nClimber 1 called several times to the belayer for \u201ctake\u201d and \u201cslack,\u201d which was pre-\nsumed to be verifying the rope arrangement. Then, presumably after removing her\npersonal anchor system from the bolts, Climber 1 fell to the ground.\n     The most likely explanation is that Climber 1 confused which side of the rope\nrunning from the bight clipped to her belay loop was the end tied to the second\nrope; she apparently thought the free-hanging length of tail was the side being\nbelayed and incorrectly clipped that side into the fixed carabiners. Thus, once she\nunclipped from the anchor bolts and weighted the rope, the free-hanging tail of\nrope quickly ran through the carabiners. After the fall, it was observed that the\ncleaned anchor attachments and Climber 1\u2019s personal anchor system were clipped\nto and intact on her harness, her harness had no damage, and her figure 8 knot was\nstill tied correctly and attached to her harness via a bight with an undamaged locking\n carabiner. Both ropes were intact and fell to the ground with her, still tied together.\n    If the two ropes hanging from the figure 8 on a bight clipped to her harness had\ntwisted and wrapped around each other, this might have led to confusion about\nthe correct strand of the rope to clip into the steel carabiners for lowering, partic-\nularly since both strands would be the same color and pattern. The tail of the rope\nwould have been at least 50 to 60 feet long (not an insignificant length or weight).\nIf the personal anchor system clipped to the bolts was relatively short, her weight\nmay have been held mostly by that system (almost a hanging belay), making the tug\nof \u201ctake\u201d more subtle. The long distance of the two-pitch route made communica-\ntion difficult, especially because a breeze was blowing. It was also the last climb\nof the day, and she may have been fatigued after climbing the full 170-foot route.\n    This accident has served as a sobering reminder to local climbers to take more\ntime to double-check ourselves and our partners. Some climbers who top-rope\nthese long routes at Diablo Canyon now place both strands of the rope that\u2019s\nclipped to their belay loop into the lowering carabiners at the anchors; this ensures\nthat even if the trail rope accidentally is clipped, the main belay rope will be clipped\ntoo. Others are now in the habit of having the last person rappel to clean the route\ninstead of lowering; we recognize that you still must not screw up the rappel, but\nthere is less potential for confusion.\n    Climber 1 was a pillar of the local community, who introduced many people to\nclimbing, and is terribly missed by all who knew her.

We\ndecided to climb Screw and Climaxe, a well-known, 350-foot WI3+ on the north\nside of Pitchoff Mountain.\n    Screw and Climaxe is notoriously thin, particularly in the bottom section. From\nthe base, the first pitch looked thin but climbable. I couldn\u2019t fully assess the thick-\nness of the ice on the entire route because the wall was plastered with snow, but I\ncould see plenty of ice near the top. Normally, I am very cautious and conservative,\nand I only lead if I can get good protection; I\u2019ve retreated from several ice leads\nbefore. But the first part looked doable, so I decided to give it a try.\n    The thin first pitch led to a ledge about 75 feet up. The second pitch started with\nsome low-angle sections with snow and ice accumulation, and I was able to put in\na stubby ice screw. I headed for a shrub in a corner and found a frozen-in sling. I\nclipped that and backed it up with a poor nut in a shallow, icy crack. The next bit\nwas a moderately angled slab covered in verglas. I placed a stubby screw partway\ninto some softish ice, then spent some time trying different routes up the slab.\nThere was a good belay stance at a tree about 15 feet up and far to the right. Above\n the tree, the ice appeared to be considerably\nmore abundant. After considering my options,\nincluding retreat, I decided to climb toward the\ntree. I was about two-thirds of the way across\nthe slab and 60 feet above the belay when I fell.\n    The top stubby screw and the worthless nut\nripped out. My right leg hit the belay ledge, and\nI finally stopped falling about 15 feet from the\nbase of the climb.

The plan\nwas to summit Mt. Haystack, Saddleback Mountain, and Basin Mountain in one day,\nunder late-winter conditions, in order to simulate a long alpine climb. There were nine\npeople in our party, mostly from the D.C. area, with varying degrees of experience. Al-\nthough I had decades of backcountry travel under my belt, including eight years in the\nmilitary, I was relatively new to mountaineering, but I had completed a winter ascent\nof Mt. Marcy, the highest peak in the Adirondacks, the previous year. As the trip leader\n(age 35), I had decided that we did not need ropes and harnesses, but I told each climb-\ner to bring the required winter gear, including snowshoes, crampons, and ice axe.\n     We planned to summit Mt. Haystack, eight miles from the trailhead, by way of\nLittle Haystack, a subordinate peak just to the north. It was clear but cold (20\u00b0F) at\nthe trailhead. We started off on snowshoes but switched to crampons where the\ntrail to Little Haystack split off. Once we reached the summit of Little Haystack,\nwe took a break to assess the route ahead: a steep and rocky descent into a col\nbefore a scramble up to Mt. Haystack\u2019s summit. Much of the rock was covered with\nice, and three members of our party were uncomfortable with the conditions and\nturned back. Among the six of us who decided to press on was my younger brother,\nChris, who was wearing Kahtoola Microspikes rather than crampons.\n    As we began the difficult descent of Little Haystack, we had not gone 50 feet\nwhen my brother, directly behind me, started sliding. I intentionally fell on top of\nhim, hoping to stop his slide and arrest both of us with my ice axe and crampons.\nInstead, we both continued to slide. My brother was able to grab a rock to stop\nhimself. Having lost my grip on my ice axe, I continued sliding until I forcefully planted\nmy right crampon onto a rock outcropping. I stopped just a few feet short of a cliff.\n    When I rolled over, I saw that my right foot had flopped over, and trying to stand was\nvery painful. We tried to call 911 but couldn\u2019t get a cell signal. Soon another hiker came\nalong and pressed his SPOT emergency beacon. We waited in place for about two hours\nbut gradually lost hope for a rescue and decided to start back toward the cars.\n    I spent the next two hours crawling back up Little Haystack and down to where\nwe had stashed our snowshoes. I made a splint from one of my snowshoes, but it\ndidn\u2019t help much. I soon tried my cell phone again and was able to get a signal. The\n911 dispatcher knew who I was and advised that forest rangers and a state police\nhelicopter were on their way. The rescue party reached me about 20 minutes later,\npackaged me in a litter, and lifted me to a hospital in Saranac Lake. My right fibula\nhad fractured in two places, and my ankle was dislocated.\n\nANALYSIS\nMy brother\u2019s fall started the chain of events that ended with my injuries, and it prob-\nably could have been avoided if he been wearing crampons instead of Microspikes.\nI didn\u2019t know he was improperly equipped until we ditched our snowshoes. As trip\nleader, I should have done a gear check the night before, and I should have turned him\naround when it became apparent that Microspikes were inadequate for the conditions.\n    Furthermore, this was the first time some climbers in our party had ever held\nan ice axe, including my brother. I did not train anyone before the outing to self-\narrest. Finally, if I had carried a SAM splint in my first-aid kit, I could have better\nsplinted my leg, which would have made for a slightly more comfortable crawl up\nand down Little Haystack.

Last August I met a pair of climbers\nat Shelving Rock, and we made plans to check out a new wall called Starbuck Cliff.\n One of the guys canceled last minute, so it was just me and his partner, who said he\nwas an experienced climber. I\u2019d just started leading trad in the spring, but was excited\nto try a crack climb that looked to be about 5.8, though we had no guidebook.\n    The bottom was casual. By the time I was 60 feet up, I had five solid pieces\nbelow me. My left hand was on a jug, and I was trying to decide what to place in\nthe crack in front of me. Then the jug unexpectedly came out of the wall. Without\nthinking, I chucked it down in the direction of my belayer, yelling \u201cRock!\u201d\n    My belayer, who was wearing a helmet, took a step backward and raised his\nhands in the air. The step back tugged at the rope against my harness. His instinct\ntook over, and he let go of the rope to take another step back. I was trying to re-\ncover my balance, but the tug didn\u2019t help. I fell about 60 feet and hit the ground.\nMy belayer, in his surprise, never recovered the rope. I landed flat on my back, on\na small strip of soft dirt between two boulders.\n    The fall knocked me out, luckily erasing all memory of the event. When I woke,\nfor a few seconds I couldn\u2019t see or breathe. It felt like there was an enormous\nweight on my chest. Slowly everything returned. I was incredibly sore, but nothing\nfelt broken so I packed up my stuff, walked to my car, and drove to the ER. (I know\nI shouldn\u2019t have.) To the amazement of myself, my friends, and the doctors, all I\nsuffered was some slightly cracked ribs and a mild head injury\u2014not even a concus-\nsion. My helmet may have saved my life.\n\nANALYSIS\nThere are a few things we can all do to avoid such incidents:\n    \u2022 Assess the holds. Knock on the rock, does it sound hollow? Does it shift at all\n      when you grab it? These are warning signs. (Editor\u2019s note: If a hold comes off,\n      be sure to throw it away from your belayer!)\n    \u2022 Assess new partners. It\u2019s important to know the experience level of your\n      climbing partner and plan accordingly. However, even an experienced\n      climber may not react appropriately to a surprise situation like rockfall.\n    \u2022 Assess the belay area. Before climbing, identify where it will be safest to\n      belay (or flee to) should rockfall occur.\n    \u2022 Consider an assisted-braking belay device. These devices add an extra mea-\n      sure of security if your belayer is incapacitated by rockfall or other events.\n      (Sources: Annie Nelson and Kevin Corrigan.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Small Cams Pulled Out\nAdirondacks, Chapel Pond Pass\nOur party of six, with three experienced climbers and three newbies, headed to\nthe Lower Beer Walls on June 25. I chose to lead a 5.8 trad route, Rockaholic, a left-\nleaning finger crack on polished granite.\n   As I started up the climb, I placed a nut and then a micro-cam. My third place-\nment was also a micro-cam, a 0.2 Black Diamond X4, in a flared crack. There was\na better place in the crack for the cam, but I didn\u2019t want to block a good handhold.\nBy this time I was about 40 feet off the ground and getting pumped out, so I quickly\nplaced a 0.4 Black Diamond X4 and leaned back to rest on the rope. But the cam\nshifted as I weighted it, and I watched it slide out. As I fell, the 0.2 cam also pulled\n out, and I hit the ground on my left side.\n   Two climbers from Qu\u00e9bec, certified EMTs, heard the fall and came over to\nassess and treat my injuries. I escaped with a laceration and abrasions to my left\nbicep, strained and torn groin muscles, and general bruising.\n\nANALYSIS\nI should have been more cautious, given my relative inexperience on crack climbs.\nIf I had asked one of the more experienced climbers to belay me, he might have\nbeen able to coach me about a bomber placement I missed about 30 feet up. My\nthird placement could have been better, which would have prevented the ground\nfall; I was concerned about blocking holds, but if given the opportunity again, I\nwould favor a more solid cam. I also should have truly tested the fourth cam before\nweighting it. (Editor\u2019s note: Micro-cams generally have far less margin of error in\ntheir placements than larger cams. See \u201cEssentials: Micro-cams\u201d on page 39.) Finally,\nwhen I started feeling uncomfortable I could have retreated, but I felt I had to push\non. I should have lowered before I got pumped out.

By now it was getting dark, and the group had\n                                      only two headlamps among the four climbers.\n                                          Pair 1 was able to complete the exposed fin-\n                                      ish of the climb with no difficulty, and they left\n                                      a rope along the route to guide Pair 2 to the\n                                      top.

Pair 2\nstayed on the large ledge at the top of pitch two and waited for rescue.\n    Rescuers arrived sometime after 11 p.m. Once voice contact and a visual on Pair\n2's headlamp was established, a single rescuer rappelled directly to them. Pair 2\nhad an anchor with three well-placed cams and was secured behind boulders in an\neffort to get some relief from the wind. Clothing, water, and food were provided.\nBoth individuals were uninjured but tired and frustrated with each other.\n    Rescuers atop the cliff set up a 3:1 haul system to assist the two climbers up the\nfinal pitch.

Although the climb\nmay be technically easy, the challenges of a tricky approach, route-finding, rope\nmanagement, and traditional protection would make this a big step for climbers\nwho are exclusively gym-trained. Finding an experienced mentor and/or build-\ning experience on shorter routes are more appropriate ways to venture onto new\ntypes of terrain.

Both the climber and the belayer sustained significant injuries,\nincluding head trauma, broken bones, spinal injury, abrasions, and burns.\n ANALYSIS\nThere was a significant weight difference between the belayer and the heavier\nclimber, which could have contributed to the belayer\u2019s inability to control the fall\nwith her ATC-style device. However, belayers who weigh much less than their\npartners usually have little difficulty holding falls, and it seems likely there must\nhave been a moment of inattention or distraction that caused the belayer to lose\ncontrol. Another observer noted that the climber\u2019s fall was slow at first and then\naccelerated. The belayer was not wearing gloves, and the burn on her hand may\nhave contributed to her being unable to regain control. An assisted-braking device\nmight have helped her maintain the belay.

While racking up, Josh noticed that no one in the group\nhad any gear larger than a number 3 Black Diamond Camalot. Nevertheless, after a\ngame of rock, paper, scissors to decide who would lead, Josh started up the climb,\nwith Jordan belaying.\n    He placed his first piece at about seven feet. After climbing an additional 10\nfeet, he began to look for a second placement, but the crack was too wide for the\nnumber 3.

Drew tossed a sling up to Josh and he\nsuccessfully girth-hitched the chockstone. However, while attempting to clip the\nrope, he lost his grip and fell approximately 20 feet to the ground, landing on his\nleft shoulder and damaging his helmet. Josh was able to respond to questions and his\nbreathing returned to normal, but during an assessment his partners noticed signifi-\ncant swelling in his right ankle.

        "Details_Factors": "Ice Tool Puncture Wound\nLittle Cottonwood Canyon, Snowbird\nI was on Rookie Party in Pipeline Bowl, above the Snowbird ski resort, on Octo-\nber 23. This is a WI4 single-pitch ice climb at about 10,500 feet. Ice conditions\nweren\u2019t great, but other than messing with my head, the conditions did not play\na role in my fall. The total climb is around 220 feet, but it is mostly low-angle ex-\ncept for a 35- to 40-foot vertical section in the lower portion. I had placed several\nscrews and rock pro prior to and through the vertical section. My last placement\nwas a 13 cm screw in solid ice, about six feet from the top of the vertical section.\nClimbing on half ropes, I clipped one of the ropes through a quickdraw attached\nto that screw.\n    At the top of the vertical section, with my tools over the lip, I was moving my\nfeet up to make the final moves when my right tool popped out. My weight was\nback, so this sent me backward. My left tool was still engaged in the ice. I assume I\nlet go of it, but I can\u2019t really remember. I yelled \u201cFalling!\u201d and soon found myself up-\nside down, with my head about five feet above a lower-angle section of the climb.\nThe top screw had held, but combining my height above the screw, the stretch in\nthe skinny rope, slack in the rope, and the distance my belayer went up the moun-\ntain, it added up to about a 30-foot fall.\n    I righted myself and lowered off the route. After a few sighs of relief and a hug\nto my belayer, I untied from the ropes and took a few steps. Blood started to pour\ndown the inside of my leg. In a few seconds there were two 12-inch pools of blood\nin the snow. The wound was a puncture high on the back of my leg\u2014basically my butt,\nclose to my crotch. We put pressure on it for about 20 minutes, but it was still bleed-\ning. Two of our team went for help, and another (who was a nurse) stayed with me.\n                                                      The Snowbird resort sent two pa-\n                                                 trollers, and four Salt Lake County\n                                                 Search and Rescue members re-\n                                                 sponded as well.

I believe either\n Courtesy of Black Diamond                       my crampon placement or one of the\n                                                 ropes caused me to flip upside down.\nSomewhere during that transition, the loaded ice tool snapped out of the ice and\nthe pick impacted my leg. The tool either hit me directly as it released from the ice\nor shot past me and then rebounded into my leg. The puncture was one inch wide\nby 1.5 inches deep. It was definitely not from a screw and could not have been a\ncrampon point, since it was too high on my butt.\n    Other than during a couple of long alpine routes, I had never climbed with um-\nbilicals until this. But I also had never fallen on ice before this. After this injury, I\nwill no longer be using umbilicals on single-pitch routes. I feel like I was actually\npretty lucky. The fall alone could have been much worse, and the tool could have\neasily impacted my head, neck, or abdomen. (Source: Brett Verhoef.)\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: As with many decisions in climbing, the choice of when to use\numbilicals on ice tools (or leashes, for that matter) varies with the situation and the\nclimber. Keep in mind that a dropped tool could have serious consequences for the\nleader even on a single-pitch climb, if he or she is unable to find protection or an\nanchor. Belayers and bystanders below also might be at risk.\n    As other reports in this edition will attest, there are potentially far more serious\nconsequences than a puncture wound for the leader who falls off an ice climb. Outside\nof modern, bolt-protected dry-tooling routes, the generations-old safety rule for ice\nclimbing is still valid: The leader must not fall.

        "Incident_Type": "ANCHOR FAILURE",
        "Details_Factors": "Poor Rock, No Backup\nCanyonlands National Park, Maze District\nOn May 25, Brent Blakenburg (30), Jason Bernard (36), Sean Finnegan (27), and Daniel\nColdfelter (36) were camped near the Hans Flat Ranger Station in the Maze District\nof Canyonlands National Park. The Maze is well known for its remote location (about\n40 miles from the nearest paved road). In the morning, Bernard began checking out\na bouldering route at the base of a 50-foot sandstone outcropping. A summary based\non Bernard\u2019s notes follows.\n    We had been looking at possible routes up several faces on the rock, and even-\ntually Dan and I decided to see if we could anchor a top-rope and attempt a pos-\nsible first ascent on this bulging mound. Right above the most viable route was\nan amazing horn. I wrapped 10 feet of webbing, tied with a water knot, around a\nthree-foot hunk of the rock; there was a perfect crease to lock the webbing into\nposition. I attached a quick-link and prepared the rope. As I dropped the top-rope\nto the ground, Dan and I spoke briefly about setting up a backup anchor but de-\ncided there were not any reliable gear placements. And the horn appeared bomber.\n    I weighted the rope to test it while standing on the ground, then Dan tied in\nand began climbing. He had some trouble with the beginning moves, resulting in a\nfew swinging falls, and asked me to tie in. I also took a swinging fall on the sandy,\ntraversing route. I weighted the rope again on a fall as I moved toward the anchor,\ncleaning off about eight grapefruit-size holds as I went. After completing the route,\nI was lowered off the climb.\n    Brent now tied in. When he was\nabout 30 feet above the ground, a\nhandhold broke and Brent fell off.\n                                           REMOTE 911 CALLS\nSean, who was belaying, caught the\nfall.

He reached the hospital only two hours after the ac-\ncident and recovered well.\n\nANALYSIS\n\u201cLooking at the scene of the accident later that day, it was easy to see there\nwere mistakes made in choosing the horn as a top-rope anchor, and we prob-\nably should not have even tried climbing [in this area] at all due to the loose\nrock.\u201d A backup might have prevented Blakenburg\u2019s ground fall, but he also might\nhave been hit by a large piece of rock if he hadn\u2019t fallen out of its way; a boulder\nimpacted right where he\u2019d been climbing. The bottom line: Some rock just isn\u2019t\nmeant to be climbed.\n    These climbers correctly completed an assessment of Blakenburg\u2019s injuries\nprior to evacuation. A full patient assessment is important to avoid overlooking\ninjuries. Disfigured limbs or bloody wounds often distract from other potentially\nserious issues, such as neck and spinal injuries, especially in ground falls. (Sources:\nJason Bernard and the Editors.)",

        "Incident_Type": "LEADER FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Loose Rock, Chopped Rope\nIndian Creek Canyon, Bridger Jack, Hummingbird Spire\nOn November 14, Kelsey Brasseur (29) and I (28) planned to climb all of Indian Creek\u2019s\nBridger Jack towers in a day. By 3 p.m. we had dispatched four of the towers and ar-\nrived at the base of Hummingbird Spire, where we ran into an acquaintance, Andrew,\nand his partner. After swapping pleasantries, Kelsey and I started up Hoop Dancer\n(5.11). Kelsey led the first pitch and I met her at the large belay ledge. Without glancing\nat the topo or even looking up, I grabbed the rack and took off toward the summit.\n    I deemed the rock too loose for any useful protection, so I ran it out up mod-\nerate terrain for 15 to 20 feet above the belay. (I later found out I was off route.)\nKnocking on each loose block before I grabbed it\u2014all of them rang with a hollow\nsound\u2014I picked the best hold I could find and pulled down. A cooler-size rock\ndislodged and fell toward the ledge below, with me underneath. The block hit the\nledge and exploded on top of me as I bounced off and continued downward, rip-\nping out the anchor piece through which I\u2019d been redirected.\n    Twenty feet below the ledge, I jerked to a stop, hanging upside down by the\nrope around my ankle. I glanced down and saw a six-foot tail of rope coming from\nmy harness. The rope had been cut in the fall. One of the smaller chunks of rock\nthat had rained down with the block had fallen directly into a wide crack on the belay\nledge and wedged itself in as a chockstone, somehow catching a section of rope. My\nfoot was caught inside this 10-foot loop, holding me only around the top of my instep.\nMy right arm was clearly broken, as my radius had come through my skin.\n    Kelsey removed the Grigri from the lead side of the rope, unburied the rope\nfrom the debris on the ledge, and fixed the longest line of undamaged rope to the\nanchor. She then rappelled about 10 to 15 feet toward me. I asked her to secure the\nrope holding me, which was somewhat precariously seated around the chockstone\n and led to my ankle, and to throw down\na line for me to secure myself.\n    She wrapped the loose section of the\nsnagged rope, above the chockstone,\naround her right hand, taking as much\nweight as possible in case the chock-\nstone dislodged. She used her left hand\nto gather up another length of undam-\naged rope and lower it with a locking\ncarabiner on a bight. I snatched the\nrope and pulled it down toward my har-\nness, but it was slightly too short.\n    I pulled myself up with my good arm,\ngrabbed the carabiner with my broken\narm, and flopped my lifeless arm toward\nmy harness. After several unsuccessful\nattempts to land the carabiner on my\nbelay loop, I landed it on my left leg loop.\nWorried I wouldn\u2019t be able to get to my\nbelay loop before my good arm complete-\nly gave out, I clipped the leg loop.\n    Kelsey was still holding the rope\naround my ankle. In order for her to\n                                               Hummingbird Spire. The accident occurred in the\nreach the anchor and fix the rope I was notch at right. Brad Brandewie\nnow clipped in to, I needed to get my\nweight off the rope. After talking with Kelsey, I reached over to the flared chimney\non my right, rammed my broken pelvis in as far as I could, and chicken-winged\nmy broken arm to establish myself. Kelsey released the rope around her hand and\nquickly fixed the rope that was attached to my leg loop. As soon as I weighted the\nleg loop and swung out, I enchained some cams from the bight in the fixed rope to\nmy belay loop (although I was still hanging off my leg loop).\n    Having heard the rockfall, Andrew ran around the corner to the base of Hum-\nmingbird. I told him our rope was too damaged to get us down on our own. He\nraced down the talus to his car and sped toward the Canyonlands National Park\nranger station.\n    As I hung by my leg loop, Kelsey gathered more rope to lower herself further\ndown and pull me over to a small ledge on my right, where we rigged up a series of\nslings to stabilize my legs.\n    An hour or two later, Andrew returned and let us know that rescue was on the\nway. It was now dark, but Andrew racked up, climbed the first pitch, and built an\nanchor above us, planning to lower me to the ground. We had a hard time getting\nme off the ledge, both because of pain and because we were trying to hold my body\nstill, out of fear of spinal cord injury. After a discussion, I decided it was worth the\nrisk to lower down without a backboard, reasoning that A) it could be a very long\ntime before SAR would be able to rig up a safe lowering setup (if they were able to\ndo this at all); B) further movement would pale in comparison to any movement/\ntrauma I\u2019d already undergone; and C) although I was not bleeding too much, we\n were aware of the risk of hypovolemic shock.\n   Andrew did a great job of lowering me slowly and communicating, allowing me\ntime to stabilize as I descended. About three hours after the fall, I was back on the\nground. Perhaps half an hour after that, a paramedic showed up, then two flight\nnurses in another half an hour. The flight nurses injected me with a steady dose of\nketamine for the long carry down the talus.\n   I sustained a broken pelvis (inferior ramus, superior ramus, and acetabulum),\nbroken back (burst L1), a broken sacrum, broken arm (open radial fracture), dislo-\ncated wrist, and damage to my sacral nerves. (Source: Craig Gorder.)\n\nANALYSIS\nBecause the two climbers were moving fast to accomplish their linkup, Gorder ne-\nglected to check the route topo to see where the line went, and as a result he got\noff route on rotten rock, but he continued without protection because the terrain\nwas easy for him.\n    Gorder was wearing a helmet, which he credits with saving his life, as the helmet\nhad a sizable depression in it and he came away with no head trauma. He had also just\ntaken a wilderness first responder (WFR) course, which allowed him to assess his own\ninjuries, remain calm, and take the lead in decision-making. (Since he was fully con-\nscious and aware, he explained, he didn\u2019t want his partner to be forced to make serious\ndecisions affecting him.) Gorder also said that bringing a SPOT or similar communica-\ntion device to this isolated cliff could have sped up the arrival of paramedics.\n    All of these climbers can be commended for their handling of a shocking and\nextraordinary accident.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Alone\nZion National Park, Moonlight Buttress\nOn the afternoon of March 9, two climbers on the Moonlight Buttress route re-\nported that someone had fallen from above them. Rangers investigated and lo-\ncated the body of a male at the base of the climb. This individual, Eric Klimt, 36,\nwas wearing a harness and climbing shoes, and he had a closed Grigri belay device\nclipped to the belay loop of his harness.\n    It is possible to hike to the top of Moonlight Buttress via the West Rim Trail.\nInvestigators found that the climber had fixed a 70-meter rope to the top anchor\non the climb, rappelled to the next anchor down, and fixed the rope again there.\nIt is common practice to fix the upper pitches of Moonlight Buttress in order to\npractice free climbing with a self-belay system. It appears this is what the subject\nwas planning to do. Other than the rope and the gear he was carrying when he fell,\nthe rest of the climber\u2019s gear remained on the rim.\n    While the exact cause of the fall will never be known, the evidence suggests he\neither rappelled off the end of the rope or made an error while transferring from\nthe rappel rope to an anchor or vice-versa. There was no knot tied in the end of the\nrope. There also did not appear to be any kind of backup on the rope or harness.\n ANALYSIS\nA knot at the end of the rope on rappels, especially where it is known that the rope\ndoes not reach the ground, adds a safety backup that may prevent a person from\nrappelling off the end of the rope. A friction hitch such as an autoblock or prusik,\ntied around the rope and clipped to the harness, provides another form of backup.\nWhen transferring from an anchor to a fixed line or rappel rope, and vice versa, it\u2019s\nessential to weight and test the new connection before unclipping from the previ-\nous system. Although it\u2019s not certain if any of these steps would have prevented\nthis tragedy, they are known to prevent many rappelling and self-belay accidents.\n(Source: Ranger Andrew P.

The other climbers were able to get help\nfrom a climbing guide above, who fixed a rope so one of Kautz\u2019 partners could rap-\npel into the gully. Kautz was found dead roughly 90 minutes after his fall. He was\nstill attached to the ropes, his rappel device was properly threaded, and there was\nno damage to either rope. (Source: Rock and Ice magazine.)\n\nANALYSIS\nDuring the previous rappels the climbers had used a flat figure-8 knot to join their\ntwo ropes, backed up with overhand knots on either side of the flat figure-8. Al-\nthough Kautz\u2019 partners did not see him tie the final knot, it\u2019s likely he too used a\nflat figure-8; it\u2019s unknown if he backed up the knot. Testing has shown the flat\nfigure-8 is prone to rolling or \u201ccapsizing\u201d under loads and is therefore not recom-\nmended for rappelling. (The new ropes in this incident reportedly had a very slick\ndry coating, possibly making it easier for the flat figure-8 to fail.) A properly tied\nand dressed flat overhand with long tails, a double fisherman\u2019s, or a Flemish bend\n(retraced figure-8) are reliable ways to join rappel ropes.\n    The distance between the climbers before the fateful rappel also contributed to this\naccident. This reportedly was Kautz\u2019 first multi-pitch climb, and he would have benefit-\nted from a more experienced partner checking his rappel setup. (Source: The Editors.)",

A\nmore experienced climber rappelled first and was at the base when the accident oc-\ncurred. The climber reportedly rigged the rappel device correctly, had an autoblock\nbackup, and was wearing fingerless gloves. During the descent, the climber lost con-\ntrol of his brake hand and slid approximately 100 feet to the right side of a ledge at\nthe start of the Skyline Traverse, sustaining a fractured ankle. The autoblock did not\nengage during this rapid descent. No fireman\u2019s belay was applied by his partner at the\nbase of the rappel. (Sources: Mountain Project and Arthur Kearns.)\n\nANALYSIS\nBased upon secondhand reports, the person likely lost control while negotiating a\nsmall roof approximately 15 feet down the rappel, perhaps in an attempt to avoid\nhitting the lip of the roof. The climber applied only two wraps of an autoblock as\na backup. The inadequate backup and failure of the partner on the ground to ob-\n serve and apply a fireman's belay to the rappel strands were contributing factors.\n    Between 2000 and 2011, 11.3 percent of all rappel incidents reported in Acci-\ndents were attributed to poor technique, while another 19.4 percent were due to\ninadequate backups. (See \u201cKnow the Ropes,\u201d Accidents 2012). In this case, either the\ntwo wraps of the autoblock were not enough to \u201cgrab\u201d the rope or the autoblock\nmay have been placed in close proximity to the rappel device, preventing it from\narresting the rappeller after the loss of control.

The\nclimber took a short fall, loading her highest piece, a finger-size cam, which then\npulled from the placement. The climber\u2019s fall continued approximately 12 feet onto\na ledge, with the initial impact being absorbed by her right foot, before the climber\ninverted and her fall was arrested just prior to hitting the ground.\n    The initial impact resulted in an open fracture that displaced the right foot\nlaterally, exposed and damaged portions of her lower tibia and fibula, severed sur-\nrounding connective tissue, and introduced a large amount of environmental de-\nbris to the wound. After lowering the climber to the ground, the belayer conducted\ninitial care for the injured limb, assessing for circulation, sensation, and movement\n(which were all intact).

However, the movement of the cam lobes on the axle was slow and unre-\nsponsive. During a fall, a cam\u2019s springs and the friction between the lobes and the\nrock are what hold the cam in place before the downward force on the cam stem\ntranslates into outward force on the lobes. \u201cSticky\u201d cams with reduced motion in the\nlobes thus are easier to pull out of a crack, especially in slippery or polished rock.

The nature of the crack re-\nquires foot placements near and just above gear. As Chad attempted the crux, his\nleft foot popped from the crack and came into contact with the lower carabiner of\nthe quickdraw attached to his uppermost nut placement. The nose of the carabiner\n penetrated the back of his foot, just forward of the Achilles tendon, and caught on the\nAchilles and calcaneus (heel), thus arresting his fall. (His belayer, Amanda Smith, said\nshe felt no weight come onto the rope.) Chad managed to pull himself up off the cara-\nbiner and was lowered to the ground.\n   Nearby climbers, including a paramedic, assessed his injury, dressed the wound,\nand assisted in evacuation to the parking area using a two-man rope litter.

(Sources: Chad Watkins, Amanda\nSmith, Jeremy Fox, and Chad Heddleston.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThe nature of the holds on this route required Chad to position his foot near his\nprevious gear placements, and very likely running behind his rope. In this instance,\nthere were no real options other than to continue to move up the route. (Editor\u2019s\nnote: A very similar accident occurred in the Shawangunks in 2016; the report is\navailable at publications.americanalpineclub.org.) While an impalement hazard like\nthis would be very difficult to foresee, it could be avoided by clipping the piece to\nthe rope with a locking carabiner.\n    Although it was not the case in this incident, there have been reports of pen-\netrating injuries from climbers deliberately grabbing gear, usually quickdraws,\nto prevent a fall.

The climber moved quickly through\nthe lower portion of the climb. Once he was within arm\u2019s\nreach of the fifth bolt, he clipped a quickdraw to the bolt\nhanger. Taking slack in the rope, the climber attempted\nto clip the draw with his right hand and at that point\nfell approximately 20 feet.

In this case the climber took a\nfall similar to many others experienced daily across the United States. The climber\ncould not recall grabbing for the rope with his left hand, though this may be the\ncase. (Grabbing the rope should always be avoided while falling.) Once the accident\noccurred, the climbers made a series of good decisions that resulted in saving the\nvictim\u2019s thumb. From placing pressure on the wound to placing the amputated\nthumb in clean, cool water, to wrapping it in plastic and storing it with ice, to rapidly\nevacuating to medical care, and finally to self-identifying a hospital with well-trained\nhand specialists, calm decision-making allowed a successful reattachment, preserved\nfunction of the thumb, and allowed the patient to return to climbing and other out-\ndoor activities just three months after the incident.

(He is believed to have been haul-\ning the device back to the stance after\none client used it for a belayed rappel\nto the Upper Saddle.) Although several\nwitnesses initially said that the guide\nhad unclipped his lanyard from the\nanchor, the fall was likely due to the\nfailure of a knot on his lanyard.\n    Numerous witnesses stated that\nthe guide was secured to the anchor\nprior to the fall. Several of the wit-\nnesses noted that he was, at times,\nweighting the lanyard. After the fall, The Grand Teton from Valhalla Canyon, showing\n                                          the long fall suffered by a mountain guide when\na 98-inch section of blue 9/16-inch his anchor tether failed at the top of the Owen-\ntubular webbing was found entwined Spalding rappel.

A photo taken prior to the technical portion of\nthe climb shows that this webbing was tied in a loop with a water knot. One tail is\nvisible and is of adequate length, but the knot is not tightened.\n    According to other guides familiar with the techniques used on the route, the\nguide may not have used this 9/16-inch webbing until he arrived at the Owen-\nSpalding rappel, meaning he would not have weighted the knot until that point\nin the day. The guide likely would have repeatedly weighted and unweighted the\nlanyard during the process of belaying his first client down the rappel, pulling up\nthe belay rope, and then trying to free the stuck rappel device. Several studies have\nfocused on the tendency of water knots to slip and fail when the tails are of inad-\nequate length and when the knots are cyclically loaded and unloaded. One of these\nstudies highlights the tendency for a significant amount of tail slippage to occur\nduring initial loading, which would have been the case had the guide not weighted\nthe lanyard until that point in the day.\n    All the evidence leads to the conclusion that the guide was tethered to the an-\nchor with webbing that was tied in a loop with a water knot, that one of the tails\n                                                      on the knot was of inadequate length,\n                                                     that the tail slipped through the knot,\n                                                     causing it to fail while he was weight-\n                                                     ing the lanyard, and that this caused\n                                                     him to fall from the rappel stance.\n                                                     (Source: National Park Service Search\n                                                     and Rescue Report.)\n\n                                                     EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: A water knot should\n                                                     be tied with both tails protruding from\n                                                     the knot at least three inches, and the\n                                                     knot must be retightened periodical-\n                                                     ly.

The\n caller stated that he was in visual and voice contact with two climbers on the Pet-\nzoldt Ridge, one of whom had taken a 25-foot fall but was not injured. The Petzoldt\nclimbers indicated they had lost their climbing rack and did not have the ability to\nrappel off the ridge or climb any more technical rock.\n    At 5:55 p.m., helicopter 38HX with pilot Wilson and rangers Bellino and Ar-\nmitage departed Lupine Meadows Rescue Cache and performed a reconnaissance\nflight. Ranger Armitage was successfully inserted to the stranded climbers\u2019 loca-\ntion. He prepared the climbers for a short-haul extraction, and the pair was flown\ndirectly to Lupine Meadows, arriving at 7:15 p.m.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe stranded climbers, both age 20, were interviewed at the Rescue Cache. Climber\n1 had approximately four years of alpine climbing experience, including climbs in\nAlaska, Peru, and the Alps. However, he did not have any significant alpine rock ex-\nperience; he stated that he had completed traditional rock climbs up to 5.9. Climb-\ner 2 only had 1.5 years of experience that was limited to gym and sport routes. They\nwere carrying a single 60-meter rope, four camming devices, one set of nuts, four\nhexes, and eight runners. Neither had climbed in the Teton Range before.\n    The rescued climbers had departed their camp at the Moraine at 3:45 a.m. and\nwere at the base of the route at 6 a.m. They reached the base of the \u201cWindow\nPitch,\u201d about halfway up the route, around noon. Here, they had trouble with route-\nfinding and spent the next four hours trying to determine the correct line. By this\npoint both climbers were exhausted and were experiencing symptoms of extreme\ndehydration and fatigue, including cramping in their fingers and lightheadedness.\nAttempting the next pitch, Climber 1 took a 25-foot leader fall, which did not injure\nhim but separated him from all of his wired nuts, equating to half of the team\u2019s rock\nprotection. Climber 2 lowered him to a large ledge on the north side of the Petzoldt\nRidge, and the two yelled for help.\n    The climbers acknowledged they had severely underestimated the physical\nstrength and endurance required by the route. It is important to choose routes\nthat are well within your ability, especially in a location that is unfamiliar. These\nclimbers also packed a fairly light rack for this climb, giving them few options in\ncase of lost gear or the need to retreat.

Moran via the Falling Ice Glacier. With one ice axe,\ncrampons, and boots, the rescued individual was equipped to climb steep snow,\nbut he did not have a partner nor any rock climbing protection, making the rope\nhe carried completely useless for fall protection. With only five meters of rope, it\n also was nearly useless for descending, even if he had found an adequate anchor\nto rappel from.\n    The Falling Ice Glacier is situated in a narrow hanging canyon, and there is little\nmargin for error when entering this area via helicopter. The landing zone is cre-\nvassed and located in the rockfall zone of the Black Rock face of Mt. Moran.

The\nclimber\u2019s partner planned to lead the entire route. Around the seventh pitch, the lead-\ner got off route. In this area, the standard route makes a long traverse onto the east\nface of Nez Perce, avoiding a steep step that is home to the Garnet Traverse Variation\n(III 5.8). The leader reportedly began up the Garnet Traverse face before making a tra-\nverse back toward the east face. He was unable to protect this traverse. When the sec-\nond climber arrived at this traverse, she broke a foothold and took a large, swinging fall\nto the right, using her feet and legs to protect her body from colliding with the rock.\n     The patient removed her climbing shoe from her right foot immediately after\nthe fall and saw that three of her toes were black and blue. She was unable to\nreplace the climbing shoe. She and her partner decided the easiest way off the\nmountain would be to continue up to the top and down the normal descent. The\npatient\u2019s partner continued leading, and the patient completed the remainder of\nthe route in her approach shoes, experiencing significant pain. She and her partner\nthen began descending the Northwest Couloir toward the South Fork of Garnet\nCanyon. She had to crawl, butt scoot, and crab walk to make slow progress down-\nward. After getting off route several times, they decided to bivy at 11:30 p.m., at the\ntop of the long talus slope leading into the South Fork.\n     At around 8:15 a.m. the patient reached Teton Interagency Dispatch Center by\nphone and reported they were still about 500 feet higher than the South Fork. She\ncould not assess whether she had good distal circulation, sensation, and motion,\ndue to the pain and the cold night out. The caller said she would continue moving\ndown and estimated it would take her one to two hours to reach the floor of the\nSouth Fork. She was asked to try to find a spot where she thought a helicopter might\nbe able to land.\n     Rangers Armitage and Edmonds flew into the South Fork of Garnet Canyon but\nwere unable to locate the patient from the air. They landed and questioned other\nvisitors, who advised them that the patient and her partner were down the canyon.\n The rangers hiked down to the patient\u2019s location, arriving at about 10:30 a.m. The\nrangers splinted the patient\u2019s foot and assisted her in hiking back up to the land-\ning zone, from which she was flown to Lupine Meadows.

Our goal\nwas Black Elk on Warbonnet Peak, which has a 5.11 offwidth crux on pitch four. We\nbegan the climb late on the morning of August 24 and moved somewhat slowly.\nI took the crux pitch and felt very tired in the offwidth. After bumping my two\nnumber 4 Camalots up the crack, I decided to run it out to the anchor. My left foot\nslipped and the resulting fall was quite big because I had told Birch to give me a lot\nof slack so a fall wouldn\u2019t slam me over the prominent roof on the pitch. During the\nfall, as my arms slid down inside the crack, the pinkie finger of my right hand got\nstuck between a cam and the rock, and my finger was lacerated severely.\n    Birch lowered me to the anchor and we then made four rappels, returned to\nbase camp, packed up camp, and hiked out. We drove to the hospital in Lander to\nget the finger cleaned, X-rayed, and stitched. Some tendons were damaged but not\ncut, and the X-ray exam found metal fragments inside the finger, probably from\n the anodized finish of a brand-new Camalot. The finger would recover, but it was\nexpected to take three months before I could fully climb again.\n\nANALYSIS\nWe started the wall too late, tired from the long drive and hike in the day before,\nand it was the first time we had done a multi-pitch or trad climb as a team.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped\nWind Rivers, Cirque of the Towers, Sharks Nose\nOn the morning of August 26, I launched from the Big Sandy Trailhead to attempt\na Cirque of the Towers traverse in a day. (This route links eight peaks with 5.6 to 5.8\nclimbing and extensive scrambling and hiking.) I had completed the traverse in one\nday, car to car, in 2013, and I was familiar with all portions of the route.\n    At the base of Sharks Nose, about midway through the traverse, I paused to eat\nand noted that the weather was colder and windier than forecast. I assessed my\nenergy/mojo level at an honest 90 percent. I figured it would be easier to bail, if\nneeded, past the traverse\u2019s technical portion. Two technical towers remained.\n    I forged up the Thoroughfare route on the northwest face of Sharks Nose\nto the notch between the south and north summits. I had brought gear for the\nroute\u2019s rappels and to rope-solo the 5.8 crux mantel on Sharks Nose if conditions\nwarranted, but I elected to free solo, having \u201cfloated it\u201d twice before. However, I\nwas unable to complete the move, nor step back down to the spire that I had just\nstepped off. I held a \u201cbeached whale\u201d position for less than a minute and then fell.\nI latched a very sloping ledge about 15 feet below, but I was unable to hold on and\nagain started free-falling. I landed on a three-foot ledge about 50 feet below. I was\npretty intact and never lost consciousness. I shook off the daze and got to work on\nself-rescue, since my injuries seemed minimal. I declined help from some climbers\non the ground (about 500 feet below) who had seen me fall.\n    I used my 66-meter rope to rappel Sharks Nose\u2019s east face, using cordage and\ngear I had brought or found, as there were no fixed anchors. When I arrived back\nat the base, my injured knee wouldn\u2019t bend enough for my foot to get back into my\nright running shoe. The party who had offered to help before had waited during my\ndescent, and now I asked for their assistance. It had been about two hours since\nmy fall.\n    The climbers had an inReach device in camp one mile away, and one of them set\nout to retrieve it while the other helped me through the talus. Soon, approximately\na dozen climbers in the area were assisting with my rescue, including a physician.\n    My hopes for making this recue non-technical were dashed as the afternoon\n                                                      turned to evening and I learned\n                                                     that a helicopter was on the way.\n                                                     [Tip Top Search and Rescue (TTSAR)\n                                                     was notified by officials in Fremont\n                                                     County at 4:35 p.m. that a rescue\n                                                     had been requested.

The equipment he carried and his\nability to self-rescue made a fundamental difference in his outcome. It is worth not-\ning that once outside assistance is requested, one never knows exactly what direction\na rescue will take, given the variables of available resources and personnel, including\ntheir experience level and climbing ability.

When she weighted the ropes again, she fell. An autoblock or other third-\nhand backup likely would have prevented this fall.\n    Carrying coils of rope while rappelling can be a good choice at a place like Devils Tower,\nwhere the many cracks can snag ropes, wind may blow the ropes far to one side, or, in a\ncase like this, for the safety of others below. It can also be a useful technique with small-\ndiameter ropes that tangle easily.

The climber placed cams at 10 feet, 45 feet, and 60\nfeet, and he was in the process of moving up the highest cam (above him at the\ntime) when his feet slipped out of the offwidth crack. As the leader was falling, the\nbelayer was able to take in a bit of slack. The climber\u2019s fall was arrested when he\nwas about five feet from the ground.

During one\u2019s apprenticeship, it\u2019s important\nto carry plenty of protection. Making use of a limited rack by bumping pieces up\nthe crack (moving them with you as you climb) is an effective tactic, but it leaves the\nclimber vulnerable to a very long fall in case of a mistake.

Assiniboine, North Ridge\nA party of two departed the Hind Hut at 5:30 a.m. on August 30 to attempt the\nnorth ridge of Mt. Assiniboine. This is the most popular route up this peak, rated\n5.5 and Alpine Grade II. Moving relatively quickly, the two climbers gained the ridge\nat first light. The previous day, they had discussed transitioning to roped climbing\nat the first steep section, called the Red Band. When the first climber arrived at the\nRed Band, however, he proceeded to solo this section. When his partner arrived\nthey discussed the change from their original plan, but the first climber was reluc-\ntant to downclimb, so after finding an easier route to the right, the second climber\nsoloed the Red Band as well.\n    After the Red Band, the terrain eased off and the two moved together, still un-\nroped, a few meters apart. Approximately 100 meters below the second steep sec-\ntion, called the Grey Band, the second climber communicated to his partner that\nit was \u201ctime to put the rope on.\u201d After a brief discussion and another 50 meters\nof exposed climbing, the first climber finally agreed that the terrain was too haz-\nardous to continue without a rope. They\ndecided to move up to a small perch that\nwould provide a suitable spot to rope up.\n    As the first climber moved toward\nthe ledge, his left handhold broke free\nand he began to fall. The second climber\nwatched him tumble down the north\nface until he was out of sight. The sec-\nond climber triggered his SPOT device\nand then slowly downclimbed to lower-\nangle terrain and waited for help to ar-\nrive. Another climbing party arrived and\nbegan to assist in the descent.\n    Banff dispatch received notice of the\nemergency SPOT activation at 10 a.m.\nOn an initial flyover, the Parks Canada\nVisitor Safety team made visual contact\nwith two other climbers on the north\nridge, who pointed in the direction of the\nemergency. After 15 minutes of searching\nthe north face from the helicopter, the\nfallen climber was located approximately Mt. Assiniboine, showing the site of a fall from\n500 meters down from the site of the fall. the north ridge on August 30. Parks Canada\n\nANALYSIS\nPrior to climbing the route, the team did a good job of preparing. They studied the\nroute and had a good understanding of the terrain they would encounter. They\nagreed on where they would use a rope and identified areas that they would travel\nunroped. They were prepared with the appropriate equipment and knowledge for\na safe ascent.\n   Two main factors influenced the unfortunate outcome of the day:\n     \u2022 Early separation between the two caused a lack of communication and a\n      departure from their original plan.\n    \u2022 Despite the popularity of this route and the ease of the climbing, the climb\n      still has a lot of loose and fractured rock.

        "Details_Factors": "SKI MOUNTAINEER HIT BY FALLING CORNICE\nAlberta, Banff National Park, Mons Icefield\nA group of seven skiers was attempting the southern portion of the Great Divide ski\ntraverse, which goes from the Columbia Icefields to Lake Louise. On May 4 they were\n using the standard bolted rappel route off the west glacier of the Mons Icefield. This\ndescent goes through a 100-meter rock band below a snow slope and cornice. They\nwere on the rappels around 10 a.m. on an overcast day, following a poor freeze.\n   The first member of the party had just reached the ledge at the bottom of the rap-\npels when a chunk of the cornice failed and entrained enough snow to create a size 1.5\navalanche that knocked him off the ledge and carried him about 40 meters downslope.\nHe remained on the surface, but was sore and shaken up. The rest of the group, spread\nout along the four rappel stations, was unaffected. They rappelled down to reach the\npatient, assessed him, kept him warm, and moved him downslope away from further\navalanche hazard. They called for help using an inReach device and a satellite phone.\n   A team of Visitor Safety specialists responded with a helicopter from Banff. Two\nrescuers packaged the injured skier, who was transported to the Banff hospital via\nhelicopter. The remaining six skiers decided to abort their traverse plans and ski\nout to the nearest road.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis challenging traverse re-\nquires favorable avalanche\nconditions, weather, and snow\ncoverage to be completed\nsafely. The winter of 2016 was\nvery warm and dry, and spring\ncame early. Snowmelt in the\nRockies was about one month\nahead of schedule.\n   The Mons rappels expose\nyou to a large cornice that\noverhangs the descent route\n                                  A cornice collapse covered the former rappel route (blue\nand falls off every year.

Parks Canada\nable; however, they tend to fall\nwhen they are big (i.e., in the spring) and when temperatures are warm or after\nwindy periods when a lot of new cornice growth has occurred. The party chose\na reasonable day with respect to the cloud cover, but the cornice would have been\nmuch more solid if they had had a good overnight freeze. They also might have avoided\nproblems if they had done the rappels at night or earlier in the morning.\n   Unfortunately, on big traverses you often don\u2019t have time to wait for perfect\nweather conditions or timing. This team rolled the dice and lost. Fortunately for\nthem, a few summers earlier, the Banff Visitor Safety team had moved the bolted\nrappel route to a more protected location in order to decrease the cornice-fall\nexposure. The skiers were using the new, more protected rappel line, and the six\nskiers who were still on the rappels when the event occurred were thus sheltered\nfrom the cornice chunks instead of being directly in the line of fire, as they would\nhave been on the old rappel route.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Data from several other climbing and skiing accidents in Banff\nNational Park is included in our tables.\n",

Rundle\nand attempting to combine pitches in order to complete the route quickly. The\nleader, a very experienced climber in his 50s, climbed and protected the upper\nportion of the second pitch, walked across a low-angle ice ledge to the base of\nthe third pitch, and started up. As he stopped to place an ice screw, he slipped and\nfell, slid back across the ledge, and fell down the pitch he had just climbed. He fell ap-\nproximately 30 meters before being stopped by his belayer just above the belay ledge.\nHe fractured his pelvis, vertebrae, and ankle, along with other more minor injuries.\n     Nearby climbing parties assisted with stabilizing the patient, while a combina-\ntion of a personal locater beacon and cell phone were used to call for help. At 2:45\np.m., three Parks Canada Visitor Safety staff were slung into the scene by helicop-\nter. The patient was packaged, slung out to a waiting ambulance, and taken to the\nhospital in Banff.\n\nANALYSIS\nWhy the climber fell is uncertain, but with a lot of rope out on low-angle ground,\nwithout any protection, he fell a long way. The easiest way to manage this hazard\nwould have been to stop and belay on the sloping ledge, since protecting the low-\nangle ice would have resulted in a lot of rope drag for the leader on the next steep\nice. The fact that he had protected the lower steep section, which allowed his be-\nlayer to stop him before the next ledge, certainly contributed to a better outcome.\n    This party was prepared with both a cell phone and a satellite communicator\nto call for help. As a result, the location and nature of the injury were quickly es-\ntablished, and the rescue was completed quickly. This helped prevent very serious\ninjuries from becoming life-threatening.",

The first climber walked across a large ice ledge\nto the anchor at the top of the final rappel while his partner pulled the ropes\nfrom the previous rappel. As the first climber approached the edge, he slipped\nand fell approximately eight meters to the base of the route, breaking his pelvis\nand several vertebrae. His partner rappelled down, established the seriousness of\nthe injuries, insulated the patient as best he could, and ran for help. A nearby group\nof three climbers stayed with the patient and provided additional warm clothing.\n    The partner hiked and drove for about an hour before finding a phone; he called\nfor help just before dark. A joint ground response was initiated by Parks Canada,\nBanff EMS, and Kananaskis Country, with rescue crews reaching the injured climb-\ner at 8:45 p.m. The climber was packaged on a stretcher, lowered down the final\nice steps, and transported 1.5 kilometers by wheeled stretcher to a staging area. A\nShock Trauma Air Rescue Service (STARS) helicopter was able to land at the staging\narea, with the crew using night-vision goggles, and at 11:30 p.m. the patient was\nflown to a hospital in Calgary.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe initial slip occurred on relatively level ground, but the climber was not able\nto prevent himself from sliding over the edge. The only real preventive measure\nwould be to stay attached to a rope or anchor while approaching an edge.\n    After the fall it became apparent that neither the injured party nor the nearby\nclimbing party had any means of calling for help. This resulted in a delay of about\nsix hours in the patient reaching the hospital. Fortunately, his injuries were not\nimmediately life-threatening, but a satellite communication device would have re-\nsulted in a much faster helicopter rescue, during daylight hours.\n    Though the accident occurred on a relatively warm day, the patient was already\nmildly hypothermic by the time rescuers arrived; the insulation the other climbers\nplaced between the patient and the ice allowed the patient to stay as warm as pos-\nsible and certainly helped in the outcome.",

A piece of protection pulled out and lengthened the fall. As the be-\nlayer stopped the falling leader, the climber swung into the wall feet-first, and he\nsustained a compound fracture of his lower right leg. The pitch had involved tra-\nversing, and the climber ended up below and to the left of the belayer. Self-rescue\nwould have been difficult, so the pair phoned for a rescue.\n    Kananaskis Public Safety responded to the call with six rescuers and a Bell 407\nhelicopter with slinging capabilities. A direct helicopter sling was attempted, but\nwind and the steep nature of the route made it too dangerous for rescue per-\nsonnel. Instead, the rescue team climbed the route to access the patient. The in-\n jury was stabilized and the patient and an attending rescuer were lowered to the\nground with a twin-rope rescue system.\n\nANALYSIS\nBoth climbers involved were experienced and prepared. However, the rock quality\nin the Canadian Rockies is less than ideal, and in this instance a hold broke with no\nwarning, despite the climber having checked it. In the Rockies, the \u201cthree points of\ncontact\u201d rule is especially important: Maintaining weight distribution evenly over\nmultiple holds allows the climber to maintain stability if one hold fails. Poor rock qual-\nity also means unreliable protection, so it\u2019s important to place pro whenever it\u2019s avail-\nable, even on easier ground.

At about 4 p.m., as the party was descending, one\nmember of the group stumbled forward and at the same time lost her grip on her ice\naxe.

The following morning, the weather improved slightly, and the injured\nclimber and rescuer were extricated using helicopter sling rescue.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe snow patches that the route crossed were very firm due to rime ice on the\nsurface. Each member of the group carried Microspikes, and the use of proper\ncrampons might have prevented the fall.\n     Two observations can be made on this party\u2019s use of the SPOT, relevant to users of\nall such devices. 1) The device continued to send a location message for several hours\nafter the initial SOS message. The group member who carried the SPOT changed loca-\ntions repeatedly, which led to some confusion on the part of the rescuers. Thankfully,\nthis climber did not move far from the injured party. 2) Once the SOS on the SPOT had\nbeen triggered, the emergency contact of the SPOT owner was notified. It would have\nbeen beneficial if this emergency contact had details of the group\u2019s trip plans.\n     The extra layers of clothing and emergency tarps the group carried would be\nsufficient for healthy people to stay warm for several hours in the weather con-\nditions the group experienced during the day.

He at-\n                    tempted to take a rest by hanging at the ninth bolt, but when\n                    he sat back on the rope, he fell to about the height of the fourth\n                    bolt, impacting a ledge during his fall. The accident occurred\n                    around 11 a.m. His final orientation in the fall was head down.\n                    Fortunately, he was wearing a helmet.\n                        The leader was initially unresponsive for about one minute, and\n                    he experienced a temporary loss of vision. His sight then returned\n                    and he complained about back pain. One of the climbers present\n                    called 911.

Poor satellite connection prevented any further information from being\nrelayed until 1:45 p.m., when an FRS radio call reached mountaineering ranger Dan\nCorn at 14,200-foot camp. A climbing party reported passing a non-ambulatory\nclimber with frostbitten fingers lying in a sleeping bag at 16,800 feet.\n    While the NPS patrol began ascending toward the injured patient\u2019s location,\nCorn learned that climbers Jay Claus and Hans Seeger had begun to lower the pa-\ntient from Washburn\u2019s Thumb, a prominent rock formation along the upper West\nButtress. Mountain guides Travis Baldwin, Michael Gardner, and Sebastian Grau\nassisted with the lowering operation until they rendezvoused with the NPS team at\n14,800 feet. The patient was evacuated to 14,200-foot camp, where he was further\nassessed and received treatment for frostbite in the NPS medical tent.\n    While waiting for the weather to clear for a helicopter evacuation, Corn and\nErickson consulted with frostbite experts at the University of Utah, who recom-\nmended prompt thrombolytic therapy (medication for eliminating blood clots). At\n8:30 p.m., the patient was flown from 14,200-foot camp directly to the airport in\nPalmer and transferred to the regional hospital by ambulance.\n\nANALYSIS\nTo prevent frostbite, adequate clothing for the prevailing conditions must be worn,\nand clothing layers that get wet (especially gloves and socks) should be changed for\ndry layers as soon as practical. It is paramount to actively rewarm any body part(s)\nthat becomes cold and numb, not only to prevent more serious injury but also to\naccurately assess the severity of injuries. Cold extremities should be rewarmed\nthrough skin-to-skin contact; in arctic conditions, frostbit areas likely will not\nrewarm with exercise alone. (Once rewarmed, frostbitten tissue must not be al-\nlowed to refreeze, as this will increase the severity of injury.) When circumstances\nprevent the rewarming of cooled body parts, climbers must seek shelter or descend\nto a more hospitable location to prevent the worsening of the injury. (Source: Denali\nMountaineering Rangers.)\n\nADDITIONAL FROSTBITE INCIDENTS: Two more frostbite incidents, involving\nthree patients, required helicopter evacuations from the 14,200-foot camp during the\n2017 season. On June 12, a 26-year-old male requested assistance at the medical tent\nafter bivouacking on Denali\u2019s summit the night before and suffering deep frostbite\ninjuries to multiple fingers and toes. The climber was treated for frostbite and signifi-\ncant dehydration before being flown out on June 13. Two days later, two climbers from\nthe same team (male, 23 and 27) descended to 14,200-foot camp following a summit\nattempt the day prior, during which they had frostbit their hands while traversing\nbelow Denali Pass. The 23-year-old patient was also exhibiting signs and symptoms\nindicative of snow blindness. Both climbers were treated overnight and evacuated\nthe next morning via the NPS helicopter.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped\nDenali, West Buttress\nAt approximately 11:30 p.m. on June 4, an un-\nroped climber fell into a crevasse just below\nthe 7,800-foot camp on the West Buttress\nRoute. The climber fell approximately 60\nfeet before coming to rest where the cre-\nvasse narrowed to about 12 inches in width.\nNumerous rangers, guides, and other climb-\ners worked for roughly 15 hours to extricate\nthe climber from the crevasse. He was severe-\nly hypothermic and sustained a brachial plex-\nus nerve injury in one arm. He was flown by Looking down the narrow crevasse where\n                                                   an unroped climber spent 16 hours before\npark helicopter directly to Fairbanks Memorial he could be freed, severely hypothermic,\nHospital soon after extrication.                   by rangers using power tools. Jake Beren\n    This 38-year-old climber was on a pri-\nvate climbing expedition with six other teammates who flew onto the Kahiltna\nGlacier on May 21 and summited via the West Buttress Route on June 3. During\ntheir descent to base camp, the team divided into two groups, with five climbers on\nskis and two on snowshoes. Prior to his crevasse fall, the patient was traveling on\nsnowshoes with one other teammate\u2014the two were not roped together.\n    Shortly after passing through 7,800-foot camp, the two climbers encountered a\nfour-foot-wide crevasse. As the first climber began to cross the snow bridge cov-\nering this crevasse, the bridge collapsed and caused the climber to fall roughly 60\nfeet, only stopping when he became wedged in the narrowing fissure. His partner\ncould not see him and returned to the 7,800-foot camp to get help.\n    Multiple guides (Bill Allen, Kristie Kayl, Erin Laine, and Karl Welter) responded\nto the calls for help and notified mountaineering ranger Joe Reichert of the situ-\nation. The guides arrived on scene shortly after midnight and were able to com-\nmunicate with the patient. These guides took turns descending into the crevasse\nmultiple times to attempt extrication. The patient was wedged in such a way that\nsimply hauling on his climbing harness would have resulted in further injury. The\nguides were able to clip into the patient\u2019s harness (in hopes of keeping him in place)\nand remove items from his backpack to allow additional room for him to breathe.\n    When the weather cleared at 3:55 a.m., the NPS helicopter was able to bring\nmountaineering rangers Dan Corn, Chris Erickson, Frank Preston, and two NPS\nvolunteers to the accident scene to relieve the guides, who had been working con-\ntinuously for almost four hours. The rescuers found the working conditions inside\nthe crevasse to be extremely challenging. After lowering to the scene, each res-\ncuer chipped away at the ice with an ice axe to create more room to extricate the\npatient. This process began about eight feet above the climber, where the crevasse\n                                                             first narrowed to about a foot\n                                                            in width.

The chainsaw was most useful at the crevasse lip, helping to open\nup the entry, and the pneumatic chisel was most effective at opening up the area\nabove and surrounding the patient. The patient\u2019s snowshoes had become wedged\nand required the most effort to extract from the ice.\n    The patient was finally freed at 3:20 p.m. During the rescue, his mental status\nhad steadily declined, to the point where he was responsive only to pain stimuli.\n    Once freed, the patient was raised from the crevasse with a mechanical advan-\ntage system and arrived on the glacier surface at 3:35 p.m., about 16 hours after\nhe had fallen. The patient was transferred to a vacuum mattress for spinal-injury\nprecautions and then flown in the NPS helicopter to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.\n(The decision to fly north toward Fairbanks was dictated by inclement weather to\nthe south of the mountain range.) The patient was treated in the ICU for several\ndays, primarily for severe hypothermia, before being discharged to return home.\n\nANALYSIS\nTraveling in glaciated terrain without a rope is never without risk. The snow\nbridges that cover crevasses degrade over time and can fail suddenly, as in this\ninstance. Moreover, there is a heuristic trap that occurs when numerous people\ncross a bridge successfully, leading subsequent climbers to believe it is solid and\nsafe. Being roped to teammates that can arrest an unexpected fall is the only way\nto prevent accidents like this from occurring. It\u2019s like a form of insurance where the\ncost is minimal and the benefits can be great.\n    The other factor highlighted by this accident was the wedging of the patient\nat the bottom of the crevasse as it narrowed. It is very unlikely that traditional\ncompanion-rescue techniques and tools would have extricated this climber before\nhe succumbed to hypothermia. A similar incident occurred in the Alaska Range in\nthe early 1980s, involving a climbing party of two, and the patient perished at the\nbottom of a crevasse when the partner was unable to free his partner. (Source:\nDenali Mountaineering Rangers.)\n\n\n CREVASSE FALL AND SHOULDER DISLOCATION: At approximately 5 a.m. on July\n14, a guide called the NPS office in Talkeetna to report that a 33-year-old male climb-\ner had fallen eight to ten meters into a crevasse at 7,800 feet on the Kahiltna Glacier.\nThe climber\u2019s rope team was able to arrest the fall, but he had dislocated his left shoul-\nder. The patient was extricated to the surface after 20 to 30 minutes in the crevasse\nand flown to Talkeetna. (Source: Denali Mountaineering Rangers.)",

It is to be noted that the three climbers had just recently\nmet on Facebook and were not regular climbing partners.\n    A 24-year old female climber sustained frostbite on May 14 during an attempt\non the Avalanche Gulch route. The climber\u2019s boots had become wet during two\ndays of snow camping and skills practice, and remained so during the summit at-\ntempt. After climbing for three hours in very cold temperatures (-10\u00b0F at 1 a.m.) and\nsix or seven inches of fresh snow, the climber reported that she had no feeling in\neither of her feet. Realizing that she was at risk for cold injury, the party descended\nfrom 11,200 feet and sought medical care. She was diagnosed with mild frostbite to\ntoes on both feet.\n    Prevention of frostbite injuries begins with dry and non-constrictive gear.\nProper-fitting clothing that is layered will help to prevent overheating and sweat-\ning. Wet socks, gloves, and other clothing should be changed as soon as practical.\nCold or numb extremities should be rewarmed through skin-to-skin contact. (Re-\nwarming of frostbitten tissue in the field should only be done if there is no possibil-\nity of the injured site refreezing.)\n     On July 2, U.S. Forest Service climbing rangers, in conjunction with two local\nguides and a California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter, rescued an injured male\nclimber in Avalanche Gulch below the Red Banks. The climber (male, mid-30s) was\nstruck on the back of the head by rockfall that precipitated a 100-foot fall down\nthe slope. He was found unconscious. The climber was stabilized and, after a hoist\nrescue, transported to Mercy Medical Center at Mt. Shasta.\n    On July 26, a 36-year-old female climber attempted to climb Shasta via the Clear\nCreek route. She and her partner got a late start and were inadequately prepared,\nboth in knowledge and equipment, for a summit bid. After separating from her part-\nner, who returned to their camp lower on the mountain, the climber continued to\napproximately 13,000 feet. At 10:39 p.m. she called 911 and requested assistance. As\nshe was uninjured and rescuers would take a minimum of eight hours to reach her,\nshe was instructed to find a safe location and to shelter in place until the morning.\n    The following day, Forest Service climbing rangers met the partner at the two\nwomen\u2019s campsite and pinged the missing climber\u2019s cell phone in an attempt to\nobtain her location. The climber\u2019s partner informed the rangers that the missing\nclimber was dressed only in a neon green dress, light hiking boots, and a small pink\nwindbreaker.\n    A full search and rescue operation was conducted throughout July 27 and 28\nand included air assets from the National Guard and members of the Marin County,\nContra Costa County, Josephine County, Jackson County, Bay Area Mountain Res-\ncue, and Shasta County SAR teams. This search continued until the evening of July\n28, when a 911 call was received from a different party who had found the missing\nclimber. She was uninjured and escorted from the mountain.\n    Two incidents on Mt. Shasta in 2017 involved knee injuries to skiers, one of\nwhom slid 100 to 200 feet after falling on icy, sun-cupped snow in Avalanche Gulch.\n(Source: Mt.

There\u2019s normally a conga line of climbers at the base, so my partner, Ben (30)\nand I (30) woke early on July 2 to make sure we were the first ones on the route. I\nhad been climbing a lot, so I was confident that the route would be well within my\nabilities. I racked up quickly with only a brief check of the beta for which cams to\nbring. I didn\u2019t read the route description in detail, which said that the crux was 20\nfeet off the deck and difficult to protect.\n    The first 15 feet was very easy terrain (<5.6). I remember skipping a placement,\nthinking that it was too close to the ground and wouldn\u2019t do anything in a fall, and\nthat there was no way I was going to fall. About 20 to 25 feet above the ground, the\njugs disappeared, and I realized I was at the crux. I fiddled around, trying to get a\npiece into a small flared crack until I was satisfied with the placement of a 0.3/0.4\nBlack Diamond X4 Offset. The crux above the piece consisted of thin, slippery 5.9\nface moves. I started getting nervous because I was expecting a crack crux\u2014I was\nless confident in my face climbing than my crack climbing.\n    Because the cam was right at my feet and I thought it was a great placement,\nI decided to just go for it. As I began to make the move, my foot slipped. I started\nfalling and watched as the cam popped out of the rock. I hit the ground (luckily\nmissing some boulders) and presumably landed on my right side, with my right\nwrist absorbing most of the impact. I rolled several feet before stopping.\n    Luckily, there was a wilderness EMT waiting to get on the climb who assessed\nmy injuries while another climber called 911. Due to the amount of pain in my wrist\nas well as some pain in my lower spine, I could not hike out. I ended up being air-\nlifted to a nearby trauma center where I learned that I had not broken my back\nbut had shattered my right wrist, broke my left thumb, and had a mild concussion.\n\nANALYSIS\nThere are a number of things I could have done differently, with the most impor-\ntant being that I should have done more research on the climb. If I had, I would\nhave known that the crux was face climbing, not crack climbing, and that it had\nground-fall potential, so I probably should not have skipped the lower placement. I\ndid not extend my only piece with a quickdraw or sling, so it\u2019s possible that the cam\ngot dislodged from its original placement. I also could have placed a backup piece\nin the crack. Finally, one should never just \u201cgo for it\u201d in trad climbing\u2014no piece is\n100 percent bomber. (Source: Jean C.) Editor\u2019s note: This particular route has seen a\nnumber of ground falls, including one earlier this year (2018), suggesting leaders who\nare near their limit should be taking additional care to protect the crux moves.",

The climbers had moved slower than expected, and, with a storm approach-\ning, they decided to rappel the route with a single rope after the pendulum tra-\nverse on pitch 10. After two rappels, the climbers found themselves without fixed\nrappel anchors and were unable to continue.\n   Cold and tired, and with bad weather moving in fast, they decided to call YOSAR.\nThey were instructed to stay put and continually exercise to stay warm. (The climb-\ners had food, water, and jackets.) By the time the SAR team had mobilized, rain had\nbegun falling in earnest and it became unsafe for them to conduct a rescue that\nnight.

From here, they rappelled to the\nnext visible anchor, the top of pitch seven of the Central Scrutinizer, a hard aid climb\nadjacent to the Nose. Their last rappel of the day took them to a large ledge system,\nwhere they built a gear anchor and pulled their ropes with the hope that they would\nfind rappel stations below. However, they were not successful, nor could they climb\nback up the line they had rappelled. Luckily, they were well prepared for an emer-\ngency bivy, with food, jackets, and water.\n    Next morning, using a spotting scope in El Cap Meadow, YOSAR determined the\nclimbers would be able to reach a large corner system midway up pitch five on the\nReal Nose route, and from there a rappel route existed to the ground. By cell phone,\nthey advised the team to rappel to this corner, build another gear anchor, and con-\ntinue their descent from there.\n    There is a tremendous amount of information available for the Nose climb and a\nwell-established rappel line. Haste may have contributed to the climbers\u2019 decision to\ncommit to their gear anchor on what should have been a bolted rappel route. (Source:\nYosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

        "Incident_Type": "FALL ON ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection, Fatigue\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, Salath\u00e9 Wall\nThe period from May 11\u201319 delivered a mix of spring weather to Yosemite. Cameron\nBrown (age 41) and I (Stephen Shostek, age 59) experienced sun, rain, snow, and\ncold weather during our Salath\u00e9 Wall climb. We sheltered for two days in the Al-\ncove (pitch 20) during a storm. Our climb was slower and longer than we expected\ndue to the storm and wet conditions, so we were stretching our food supply.\n    We spent our final night on Long Ledge after a long day\u2014I finished cleaning the\nHeadwall at 2:30 a.m. Next morning I started aiding the pitch above Long Ledge,\nmostly on small cams and offset cams, up to the flaring scar where a fixed pin\nshown on the topo formerly had resided. I pounded a cam hook into the flaring\npin scar with the heel of my hand. As I weighted the cam hook, a few grains of\ngranite fell from the crack, so I figured the hook wouldn\u2019t hold for long in the flare.\nAs I assessed the 5.10 free moves required to move leftward to easier ground, the\ncam hook pulled, the Metolius offset placed in the flaring crack below pulled, and\nmy fall was arrested by a Metolius 00 Master Cam in a parallel section of the thin\ncrack. My 25-foot fall was clean and caused no problems.\n    I aided back up to the Metolius 00, seated it deeper into the crack, replaced the\noffset cam that had pulled from the flare and aided up on it, and again pounded\nin the cam hook with the heel of my hand. I saw another, smaller pin scar in the\nseam two feet higher and placed another cam hook in this flaring scar, hoping it\nmight hold my weight more securely. However, the higher cam hook failed while I\nwas testing it, as did the lower cam hook and the offset cam, and this time the 00\nMaster Cam also pulled out of the crack. I had back-cleaned some offset cams in\nthe flaring crack above a 0.3 Camalot much farther down the crack, since they ap-\npeared to be useless to arrest a fall. My fall was finally stopped by the 0.3 Camalot.\n    I fell about 50 feet, and near the bottom my left foot snagged on a protruding\nfin of granite. I suffered an avulsion fracture of my left fibula at the talofibular liga-\nment attachment, soft-tissue damage to my left ankle and foot, and an avulsion of\nthe distal attachment of the extensor tendon on my left pinkie finger.\n    Cameron lowered me back to Long Ledge, and we assessed our options. I was\nunable to reclimb the pitch with my injured left ankle, but reasoned that I was\nable to jug a rope with one good foot. Luckily, Alex Honnold and James Lucas were\npassing above us on Freerider, and they offered to fix our rope and help us haul\nour gear up the final two pitches. I jugged to the top and assessed that my injured\nankle was able to bear some weight tolerably if I carefully weighted only the heel\narea, so I resolved to get down the East Ledges descent without calling for rescue\nassistance. I limped, crab crawled, and butt slid down to the rappels and out the\ntrail to the road.\n\nANALYSIS\nThere are a few things I could have done differently to prevent my accident and\ninjury. The thin crack where I placed the Metolius 00 is parallel sided, unlike the\nflaring crack below. I should have added another cam and equalized them in the\nrelatively secure parallel portion of the crack. Likewise, the flaring placement for\nthe offset cam might have been able to hold a fall if I\u2019d equalized additional cams.\n                                                 I also might have tried placing offset nuts\n                                                in the flaring crack below the Metolius 00.\n                                                    Fatigue played a role in my accident. I\n                                                was aware of feeling dull-minded when I\n                                                started the pitch due to inadequate sleep,\n                                                reduced food rations, and burning addi-\n                                                tional calories in the cold weather. With\n                                                sharper cognition, it\u2019s likely that I would\n                                                have backed up the micro-cam. It\u2019s also\n                                                possible that I would have launched more\n                                                quickly into the 5.10 free climbing above the\n                                                missing fixed pin and thus avoided the fall.\n                                                [Editor\u2019s note: This pitch is rated 5.8 C1+ in\n                                                some guidebooks, but is generally considered\n                                                to be significantly harder\u2014many say it is\n                                                the crux of the Salath\u00e9 when done as an aid\n                                                climb.] Additionally, I had climbed this pitch\n                                                once before, in 2000, and in retrospect\n                                                I can see that I was overconfident about\n                                                climbing it this time.\n                                                    Months after the accident, I was back\nClimber QX Cheang (unrelated to this\n                                                to climbing, although with some pain and\nincident) starting up the tricky pitch off Long\nLedge on the Salath\u00e9 Wall.

The boyfriend told responders\nthat she had lost consciousness for several minutes after the fall.\n    Once the SAR team stabilized and packaged Barbara in a litter, they lowered her\nfrom the pinnacle and carried her out to an ambulance at the parking area. She had\nmultiple spinal and skull fractures, a broken nose, simple pneumothorax, a broken\nrib, and a number of more superficial injuries, but she lived.\n\nANALYSIS\nTo the best of her recollection, Barbara had been rappelling the second pitch of\nHarry Daley. She had descended about 10 to 15 feet past the usual belay stance atop\n the first pitch and swung left to pick up some equipment they had dropped while\nclimbing. She retrieved both pieces, clipped them to her harness, and moved back\nright. After this, she stated, the last thing she remembers was noticing that there\nwas not very much rope left below her tube-style rappel device.\n   The rappels from this two-pitch route can be done with two 60-meter ropes\nor a single 70-meter, but the first rappel is a stretcher with a 70. (It is believed the\nclimbers were using a 70-meter rope.) Barbara did not have any knots tied in the\nends of her rope, and did not have a hands-free backup. Barbara, who had six or\nseven years of climbing experience, five of which involved outdoor lead climbing,\nstated in a follow-up interview that she used to always tie knots in the ends of her\nrope while rappelling but stopped due to friends making fun of her.\n   A hands-free backup (such as an autoblock) might not have prevented this ac-\ncident, but it would have given Barbara more control during this rappel.

        "Details_Factors": "Ropes Too Short, Helmet|No Helmet\nYosemite Valley, Swan Slab and Church Bowl\nOn July 3 there were two climbing accidents almost identical in nature in the Val-\nley. Both were ground falls, and both resulted from a belayer lowering the climber\nwith a rope that was too short for the pitch.\n    At approximately 7 p.m., Yosemite dispatch received a report that a climber\nhad fallen from the Swan Slab Gully (5.6). YOSAR and the Valley ambulance quickly\narrived on scene. The first responders found a mid-20s male lying on the ground\nface up, being held by his climbing partner. While the climber was conscious, he\nwas disoriented and struggling to stay awake. Furthermore, he was complaining of\nback and hip pain, and witnesses stated he may have hit his head. He did not have\non a helmet. After the climber was assessed and packaged for transport, the rescue\nteam carried him the short distance to the road, and he was evacuated from the\nAhwahnee meadow by medical helicopter at approximately 8:10 p.m.\n    Other climbers in the area stated the climber, a beginner, was being lowered\non top-rope when the end of the rope slipped through the belayer\u2019s device. It was\ndetermined in these interviews that the fall was around 25 feet. The climber\u2019s rope,\nmeasured by NPS employees, was only about 98 feet long. The route is about 60 feet\nhigh and would require at least 120 feet of rope to lower a climber from the bottom.\n    Immediately following the Swan Slab accident, Yosemite dispatch received a\nreport of a ground fall at Church Bowl. The reporting party stated that the climber\nwas on Black is Brown (5.9) and had fallen about 20 feet. YOSAR found a male\nclimber in his mid-20s at the base of the climb. He complained of hip and back\npain, but had suffered no loss of consciousness. The patient had a helmet, which\nhad impacted the rock and cracked during the fall. The climber was assessed in the\nhospital and released that evening with no major injuries.\n    In interviews after the accident, it was determined that the climber was being\n lowered from a tree anchor after leading the climb. At approximately 20 feet off\nthe ground, the end of the climber\u2019s rope passed through his partner\u2019s belay de-\nvice. While one guidebook states that the climb is 80 feet tall, the anchor that the\nclimber used was over 100 feet off the ground, requiring a 70-meter rope to lower\nor rappel all the way to the ground. The patient believed his rope to be 70 meters,\nbut the SAR noted that the rope was visibly cut at both ends, and upon measuring\nthey determined the rope to be about 62 meters. This was the first time the two\nclimbers had met and was the patient\u2019s first climb in Yosemite.\n\nANALYSIS\nBoth of these accidents could have been avoided with some basic safety measures.\n   Close the belay system. A stopper knot at the belayer\u2019s end of the rope or tying\nthe belayer into his or her end would have prevented both of these ground falls.\n   Know your rope, know your route. Both parties were climbing on ropes that\nhad been intentionally cut to a shorter length. If you choose to modify your rope,\nknow exactly how long it is and tell your climbing partners. And never blindly trust\nguidebooks. In the Church Bowl accident, the climber used an anchor that was\nroughly 30 feet higher than the guidebook\u2019s listed distance.\n   Both climbers impacted their heads during their falls. At Church Bowl, the\nclimber\u2019s helmet was heavily damaged by the fall but he escaped serious injury.\nWithout the helmet, the outcome could have been tragic.

        "Details_Factors": "Yosemite Valley, El Capitan\nOn the afternoons of September 27 and 28, a series of rockfalls occurred on the far\nright side of El Capitan, near the line of Horsetail Fall. The initial rockfall on Sep-\ntember 27 struck two climbers who were walking along the base of the cliff after\nretreating from the East Buttress route. One of the climbers, Andrew Foster, 32,\nfrom Wales, was killed by the rockfall. Witnesses reported that he had rushed to\nshield his wife from the debris when he was hit. She was seriously injured and was\ntransported by short-haul helicopter rescue to El Cap Meadow and then to an area\nhospital for treatment.\n   Over four hours, six more rockfalls occurred, for a total volume of about 450 cubic\nmeters (a cubic meter is about the size of a washing machine) or about 1,340 tons.\n   A much larger rockfall occurred in the same general area on September 28. This\none measured 10,250 cubic meters in volume, or about 30,500 tons. The rockfall\ngenerally propagated upward and outward from the origin of the September 27\nrockfall, greatly expanding the overall source area. Boulders reached the Valley\nfloor, and smaller fragments traveled to Northside Drive. One piece struck a ve-\nhicle, hitting the driver and causing a head injury.\n   The September 28 rockfall ranks as the 29th largest on record in Yosemite. It\nhad been 18 years since the last rockfall-related fatality in the park, when climber\nPeter Terbush was killed by a rockfall from Glacier Point on June 13, 1999.\n ANALYSIS\nMost rockfalls in Yosemite occur in\nthe winter and early spring, during\nperiods of intense rainfall, snowmelt,\nand/or subfreezing temperatures, but\nlarge rockfalls\u2014like these ones from El\nCapitan\u2014have occurred during peri-\nods of warm, stable weather.\n    How can climbers address rock-\nfall risk? Unfortunately there are no\nhard or fast rules, but rockfall areas\nare often active for many hours, days,\nor even months, so avoid climbing in\nrecent rockfall zones. The \u201cprogres-\nsive\u201d nature of the El Cap rockfalls,\nwith several events from the same\nlocation, has also been seen at oth- Rockfall on the right side of El Capitan in September\n                                           2017.

Fresh talus and/or damaged\nvegetation at the base of your intended climb are good indicators of recent activ-\nity. Be especially aware of cracking or popping sounds emanating from the cliffs, as\nthese sounds have preceded many rockfalls.\n    A helmet may not save you from a large rockfall, but it could offer protection\nfrom \u201cflyrock\u201d that accompanies most rockfalls. Minimize your time approaching\nor bivying at the bases of cliffs, particularly those in known rockfall zones. (Source:\nClimbingYosemite.com/Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Speed Climbing, Inadequate Protection\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, The Nose\nOn October 11, Quinn Brett (female, 30s) was attempting a Nose in a Day ascent\nwith Josie McKee when she took a very long fall while leading the right side of the\nBoot Flake. The two women were using speed-climbing tactics: Brett was effec-\ntively roped soloing while McKee ascended a portion of their rope that had been\nfixed to the previous anchor, at the top of Texas Flake. Brett had back-cleaned sev-\neral aid pieces between the top of the bolt ladder off Texas Flake and the bottom of\nBoot Flake, and she did not leave any protection in Boot Flake, a hand crack rated\n5.10c. Consequently, when she fell, the fall distance was greater than 100 feet. She\nimpacted the sloping left side of Texas Flake (her right scapula took the brunt of the\nfall) and came to a stop among some boulders lower down without the rope coming\ntight. She was wearing a helmet, but it came off during the fall or impact.\n    McKee, a veteran of YOSAR, rappelled to Brett, telephoned for help, and prepared\nthe scene for a rescue. Rangers were heli-slung to the top of El Cap Tower, just be-\nlow Texas Flake. They placed Brett in a litter, and she and a ranger were flown off\nthe wall to El Cap Meadow.

        "Incident_Type": "FATAL FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Possible Rappel Error\nYosemite Valley, Fifi Buttress\nOn November 17 two friends of Niels Tietze hiked to the base of Fifi Buttress to look\nfor their overdue friend. The two knew that Tietze had been up on the formation,\n working to establish a new route, and had been doing so alone, using fixed lines\nand self-belay techniques. It was late in the season and he was most likely remov-\ning his ropes and gear from the wall. Nobody had seen Tietze since earlier in the\nweek, and he had missed climbing plans with friends the day before.\n    When the two arrived at the base of the cliff they discovered Tietze\u2019s body and\nimmediately recognized that he had taken an unsurvivable climbing fall. At ap-\nproximately 2 p.m. they notified SAR by cell phone.\n    At the scene, park rangers found Tietze wearing a climbing harness. His shoes\nwere off, but there were two climbing shoes found nearby. He had climbing gear\nclipped to his harness, including cams, carabiners, and slings. There was also an\nadjustable wrench and round wire brush. A low-stretch, 254-foot rope was found\nstrewn about the scene. The rope was not connected to the harness. There were\nno knots in the rope. The midway point was looped into one slot of a rappel device\nas if for a single-rope rappel. The retention cable of the friction device was broken.\nThe rappel device was not attached to the locking carabiner found on the harness.\n    The carabiner attached to the harness belay loop had a screw lock with the\nscrew in the locked position; however, the gate was effectively locked open be-\ncause the nose of the carabiner was not captured by the screw lock.\n    Since Tietze was by himself at the time, no one can know for sure what hap-\npened. The findings at the scene suggest he might have accidentally weighted a\nrope set for a doubled-over rappel with only one strand of rope in the device and\ncarabiner. However, the fact that the ATC and rope were not connected to his har-\nness when he was found detract from this theory and could be explained only if\nthey had managed to come out of the \u201clocked open\u201d carabiner during the fall.\n    A second option would be that an unknown event interrupted Tietze as he was\nrigging for rappel\u2014after he passed the rope through the ATC but before the ATC was\nclipped to the carabiner in his belay loop. An attempt to grab the rope could explain\nhow it made it to the ground. There is simply no way to know if this was the case.\n    The broken retention cable on his rappel device is unusual, but in and of itself\nwould not have caused an accident to occur, as the retention cable does not assist\nin the operation of a plaquette device. The \u201clocked open\u201d carabiner certainly could\nhave played a part in the accident. However, the fact that the middle mark of the\nrope was through his rappel device strongly suggests a rappel rigging error.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe following lessons are among those that can be drawn from this tragic incident:\n    \u2022 Always clip in directly to each anchor while preparing to rappel. Whether\n      using a manufactured or home-rigged PAS (personal anchor system), a Pur-\n      cell prusik, or the slings on hand, it is extremely important to attach yourself\n      to the anchor while rigging for rappel.\n    \u2022 Test your system. After going in direct and rigging for rappel, weight and\n      test your system before unclipping from the anchor. Verify that you have\n      done everything correctly before trusting your life to a rappel.\n    \u2022 Always use a \u201cthird hand\u201d backup. When you attach a third-hand backup such\n      as a kleimheist or autoblock prior to loading your rappel device, you have a pre-\n      liminary point of attachment to the rope. If all else fails, it could save your life.\n       \u2022 Be extra cautious when alone. No one else is there to check your systems,\n        and no one is there in case of an accident.\n      \u2022 Beware complacency. Niels Tietze was a climber of the absolute highest\n        caliber. He had spent years of his life rescuing people off the walls of Yosem-\n        ite. It only takes one bad rappel after thousands of well-executed ones for\n        something like this to happen.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled out\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, Zodiac\nOn the morning of December 2, I started up the first pitch of Zodiac (5.9 A3) on El\nCapitan. I was roped soloing and planning for three or four days on the wall. I had\nled this first pitch two other times.\n    I climbed the pitch clean (no pitons, C3+) and was about 10 feet from the an-\nchor, underneath a small roof, when the small offset nut I was weighting blew out.\nAs I fell, two marginal placements beneath me also pulled out. The next piece was\na well-placed 0.75-sized cam. Surprisingly, this piece sheared out of the parallel,\nnon-flaring granite crack. Below this was a well-placed nut, which somehow came\nunclipped from the rope. And below this was another 0.75-size cam\u2014the carabiner\nclipped to this cam broke, presumably due to a \u201cnose hook.\u201d\n    In all, six placements pulled out or otherwise failed, and I fell approximately\n                                             110 feet, stopping at eye level with\n                                             the first bolt on the route.

The climber even C1 placements in splitter cracks,\nestimated he fell 110 feet. Parker Kempf           just to be sure the piece does not shift\n out of its optimal placement. The first pitch of Zodiac gets very high traffic, which\nhas led to an infamous amount of \u201cpolishing\u201d in the crack. I certainly was not ex-\npecting a well-placed 0.75 to shear out of solid rock, but maybe the polish has\nreduced the rock friction so that a nut would have been more appropriate here.\n    It had not rained at all recently, but it was early morning in winter. Although I\ndid not notice the rock was wet, it\u2019s possible there was dew or other moisture in\nthe crack, exacerbating the polished rock issue. Again, passive protection would\nhave probably held better at this placement. Perhaps it also would have helped to\nwait a little before starting and let any morning dew evaporate.\n    Because I was roped soloing, I was not using quickdraws or extending place-\nments; my rope was fixed to a ground anchor, and I fed slack through the \u201cbrake\nside\u201d of my solo belay device. (There is no rope being pulled through protection in a\nlead roped-solo scenario.) It\u2019s possible, though far from certain, that extending the\n\u201cfailed\u201d pieces with quickdraws might have made the cam less likely to pull out, the\nnut less likely to come unclipped, and/or the carabiner less likely to break.\n    The broken carabiner, an old-style Camp Photon, had a distinct notch between\nend of the nose of the carabiner and the \u201cbasket.\u201d This notch was prone to snagging\nslings and other gear, and \u201cnose hooking\u201d significantly weakens a carabiner. Using\na key-lock carabiner with a narrower angle to its basket would have helped keep\nthe force of the fall along the spine of the carabiner. (Source: Parker Kempf.)",

The reporting party (Jeff, also in his 20s) said he was Matt\u2019s climbing\npartner and had witnessed the fall, and that Matt had died.\n    Matt and Jeff had met in person only a few days prior to their climb, after strik-\ning up a friendship on an online climbers\u2019 forum.

They arrived at the base sometime before noon and prepared for the\nclimb. They had brought two 60-meter, 8.5mm half ropes and discussed the pros\nand cons of using both simultaneously (as per design) or using just one to sim-\nplify rope management.

At the first be-\nlay stance, they prepared to swap leads and discussed strategy for the next pitch.\nThe most frequently traveled route would have led slightly climber\u2019s left of the\nbelay station but involved a spooky step-across move that made Matt uncomfort-\nable.

Jeff later said that Matt\n                                                        became increasingly nervous as they\n                                                       discussed the options; he offered to\n                                                       lower Matt to find a better route or\n                                                       even call off the climb. Matt decided\n                                                       he would take the climber\u2019s right op-\n                                                       tion. Somewhere between noon and\n                                                       1 p.m., he started climbing.\n                                                            After several moves, Matt was\n                                                       able to sling a horn with a runner. He\n                                                       continued to climb up and right on\n                                                       the face. Jeff reported that his last\n                                                       words to Matt were, \u201cDon\u2019t climb up\n                                                       anything you can\u2019t climb back down.\u201d\n                                                            Matt reached a point about five to\n                                                       ten feet past his protection and out of\nArea above the first belay on Matthes Crest.

Jeff yelled down sev-\neral times without any response.\n    After several moments he pulled the rope back and saw that it had been broken\nor been cut. Jeff took several moments to establish a rappel anchor and then rap-\npelled on the remaining rope to the base of the climb, where he found that Matt\nhad died from his injuries.\n    Jeff attempted to call 911 numerous times but was unable to get a call through.\nHe decided to hike to the north end of Matthes, about 1.5 miles away, where he\neventually was successful in making a 911 call. He was instructed to return to the\naccident site and wait for rescue personnel. At approximately 5 p.m., SAR team\nmembers had arrived on scene at the base of Matthes Crest and confirmed that\nMatt had been killed in the fall. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)\n\nANALYSIS\nBased on an examination of the rope and the site of the fall, it is likely the rope cut\nas it slid along one or more of the sharp flakes or crystals in the area. The victim\nwas climbing an ar\u00eate to the right of his only protection on the pitch, and the rope\nwould have dragged along the face under tension as he fell. After the fall, about 20\nfeet of rope remained attached to the victim, plus about three feet of exposed core.\n    It\u2019s impossible to know if this accident would have occurred had the party been\nusing both of the half ropes, or if they had been using a single-rated rope. Technical\ninvestigators who surveyed the scene stated that a larger rope might also have been\ncut in the same situation. Nonetheless, a climb such as this, especially early in one\u2019s\nclimbing career, is no place to test the boundaries of one\u2019s equipment. When a rope\nsystem is tested and rated to be used a certain way, that is how it should be used.\n     The evidence suggests a rope cutting over an edge led to this fatality, but the\nclimber\u2019s fall is what caused the rope to cut. While the two climbers seemed to be\nwithin their physical capabilities, a route like Matthes Crest may have been inap-\npropriate for the team, based on their alpine experience. Finding the best line on\nthis climb (as with many High Sierra climbs) requires route-finding skill; it\u2019s also im-\nportant to have the ability to downclimb or traverse out of unexpected difficulties.\nPushing your personal comfort zone is best done in less committing environments.\n(Sources: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers and the Editors.)",

        "Incident_Type": "RAPPEL ERROR",
        "Details_Factors": "Rappelled Off End of Rope in Storm\nYosemite National Park, Matthes Crest\nMy climbing partner and I were attempting to climb Tenaya Peak, Matthes Crest,\nand Cathedral Peak\u2014three long but moderate routes in the Tuolumne Meadows\narea\u2014in a day. Because of the sheer amount of climbing and distance we would\nneed to travel, we packed light, opting not to carry any warm or waterproof layers.\n    We left our car at 6 a.m. and summited Tenaya at roughly 9:30 a.m., then hiked\n3.5 miles over to Matthes Crest and began climbing around noon. About 2 p.m. we\nnoticed what looked like thunderstorms far in the distance, but the clouds seemed\nto be moving away from us, so we continued. At 3 p.m., as we were nearing the\nsouth summit, we noticed clouds forming directly above us, so decided to bail\nand began searching for a descent. We found a gully on the west side, just before\nthe south summit, that had slings around various trees in it. We scrambled down\naround 30 feet to the first tree anchor and began flaking our 60-meter rope.\n    Almost immediately, it began hailing and a lighting storm started directly on\ntop of us. In such an exposed position, we were shaken and began rushing. Rather\nthan properly flaking the rope out and finding the midpoint (our rope did not have\na middle marker), I tied knots in both ends and sent my partner down the rappel\nimmediately, figuring we needed to get below the top. Before reaching the next\nrappel tree (only about 40 feet below), he had to stop and untangle the rope and\nreposition the rope ends, which took some time.\n    Eventually, he made it to the next tree anchor and I quickly descended to join\nhim. Dime-size hail was falling, and lightning was all around us. In my haste, I didn\u2019t\nmove the rappel lines out of the constricted gully we were rappelling and onto the\nface. When we went to pull the rope, it became stuck. Luckily, I also had brought a\n65-meter static tag line. So, while my partner continued to try to free the stuck rope,\nI began uncoiling the thin tag line. It almost immediately tangled. Again, opting for\nspeed over thoroughness, I eyeballed what I thought was the midpoint and tossed\nthe ends down. In my haste, I only tied a stopper knot in one end.\n    As I began to rappel, I had to stop multiple times to pull the loose ends of the\nrope out of the waterfall-filled gully. After about 25 meters, I reached the base of\nthe vertical wall and was standing on a 45-degree slab. Feeling confident that I\nhad made it down to scrambling terrain, I began scouting for a good stance to go\noff rappel. As I descended a few more feet, the unknotted end of the rope slipped\nthrough my ATC and my autoblock and I began tumbling. I rolled 50 feet down a\ntiered rock slab before finally coming to a stop.\n     Miraculously, I survived relatively unscathed. My helmet was dented, and I had\nlarge gashes in my left knee and right arm, but no concussion, broken bones, or\nother serious injuries. Also, I had not pulled the tag line down with me when I fell, so\nmy partner was able to reset the rappel (properly this time) and rappel down to me.\n    We had no cell phone service, no warm or dry gear, and were about six miles\nfrom the closest trailhead. We had a bivy sack with us, but decided it would be bet-\nter to keep moving rather than wait out the storm. Leaving the ropes behind, we start-\n                                                 ed hiking. Six hours later, at 9:30 p.m.,\n                                                 we reached the trailhead and someone\n                                                 offered us a ride back to our car at\n                                                 Tenaya Lake, from which we drove to\n                                                 the closest ER.\n\n                                                     ANALYSIS\n                                                     I am acutely aware that rappelling\n                                                     accidents typically don\u2019t end this\n                                                     well. One conclusion you might take\n                                                     away from this account is that peo-\n                                                     ple should recommit to perfect rap-\n                                                     pelling practices: Always tie stopper\n                                                     knots, always make sure the mid-\n                                                     point of the rope is at the anchor,\n                                                     always use a backup, etc. I agree\nLooking northward along Matthes Crest. The climbers\nin this incident descended to the left (west) before\n                                                     wholehearted      with these practices,\nreaching the first summit. Roman Smart               but in a crisis even well-trained people\n                                                     are prone to making mistakes. The real\nlessons for me are how to avoid a crisis situation in the first place.\n     To that end, I think there are several takeaways. First, we were in the high-\ncountry, far from any road, and it was utterly irresponsible not to have more warm\nclothing and raincoats. While the lightning was dangerous, I believe it was the cold\nand wet that ultimately caused me to take shortcuts while rappelling.\n     Second, we should have begun descending the moment we saw signs of storms in\nthe distance. A desire not to leave gear was part of the issue, and our desire to finish\nthe trifecta of climbs we had started also probably led us to make a bad decision. The\nfear of lightning then led me to rush the rappel setups. Given all the tangles and the\nstuck rope, I don\u2019t believe rushing this way saved us any time at all.\n     Finally, and this is a minor point, a rope with a midpoint marker makes it a lot easier\nto set up a good rappel.

        "Details_Factors": "Overcrowding, Inexperience\nYosemite National Park, Cathedral Peak\nOn Friday, August 25, five climbers left the Bay Area with the goal of climbing Ca-\nthedral Peak. The team consisted of two experienced climbers (Ben and Nate) and\nthree with little to no experience outside of the gym (Megan, Erin, and Andrew). All\nclimbers were in their mid-20s.\n     Ben and Nate each had seven to ten years of climbing experience. Furthermore,\nthey had gone to a self-rescue course together a year or so prior, and both had\nclimbed Cathedral Peak numerous times.\n    On Saturday, August 26, the group arrived at the base of Cathedral Peak around\n11:30 a.m. The southeast buttress is a very popular 5.6 climb, and this day was ex-\ntremely busy, with an estimated 30\u201340 people on the route and at the base, includ-\ning approximately 10 parties on variations of the first two pitches alone.\n    Due to the number of people on the \u201cstandard\u201d start (route \u201cA\u201d in the popular\nSupertopo guidebook), the team decided to move right and start up what they\nbelieved to be route C. (During the investigation, it turned out they were closer\nto route B.) At around 12:45, they began climbing in two separate teams: Ben, Erin,\nand Megan, climbing with two ropes, and Nate and Andrew, climbing with one\nrope. Ben started leading on the left (staying fairly true to the \u201cB route\u201d), while Nate\nheaded up a ways to the right. Both leaders soon got to the first ledge system, set\nup anchors, and began bringing up their partners.\n    Ben started belaying Erin first, and once she was a ways up the pitch, he began\nbringing Megan up on the other rope. Nate had already brought Andrew up to the\nfirst belay ledge and was getting ready to begin leading pitch two.\n    At about 1:15 p.m., Megan reached a point about 30 feet off of the ground, just as\nErin was arriving at the belay ledge. After manteling onto the left side of the ledge,\nErin put her foot on what appeared to be a solid rock and began to stand up. She\nfelt the rock below her give way, and it fell toward Megan. Everyone who saw this\nbegan screaming, \u201cROCK! ROCK! ROCK!\u201d to get Megan\u2019s attention. Megan saw the\nmicrowave-size block coming at her and moved to the right to get out of the way,\nbut during its fall the rock hit something and changed its trajectory, causing it to hit\nMegan directly on the head. The impact knocked Megan unconscious.\n    As soon as the accident happened, Ben decided it was of the utmost importance\nto gain access to Megan and try to get her to the ground. The best course of action\nseemed to be to get Erin the rest of way to the belay, leave her attached to the an-\nchor through his ATC Guide device, and fix the rest of her rope to the ground. This\nwould allow him to rappel to Megan. Since his ATC was being used to keep Erin (and\nMegan) attached to the wall, he rappelled using a Munter hitch. Ben stated that he\nmis-tied the knot a number of times due to the frantic nature of the situation.\n    Nate also prepared to rappel. Leaving Andrew attached to the anchor with a\npersonal anchor system (PAS), Nate doubled over his 60-meter rope and began\nrappelling toward Megan using an extended ATC with a prusik autoblock. To reach\nher, Nate had to pendulum hard left. Neither he nor the rest of the team noticed\nthat after swinging over to a different area of the wall, his rope no longer reached\nthe ground, due to the sharp elevation change along the base of the cliff. This will\nbe important later in the narrative.\n    At the time of the accident, another team consisting of Patrick (male, 40s) and\nhis partner had reached the base of the climb. After witnessing the event, Patrick\nasked his partner to belay him up to Megan. When he arrived at the scene, Patrick\nrequested that Nate put in some gear for him. Nate placed a number 1 and number\n2 Camalot, and Patrick clipped in to this temporary anchor with a PAS.\n    Meanwhile, Jenny, an emergency room doctor who also had started up the\n                                                            southeast buttress, downclimbed\n                                                           to the ground so she could help.\n                                                           It was decided that the best way\n                                                           for Jenny to gain access to Megan\n                                                           was to tie in short on Patrick\u2019s\n                                                           rope.

The team also\n                                           created a chest harness out of a shoulder sling\n                                           to help keep Megan upright.

A ground team and helicopter both\nwere dispatched to the scene. At 3:17 pm, as the helicopter was doing a recon over\nthe accident site, it was noticed that CPR on the patient was beginning. The ground\nteam arrived on scene at approximately this time.\n   At 3:53 pm, after regaining pulses in the patient, she was short-hauled to a\nnearby landing zone, where she was then loaded into the helicopter and flown to\nCrane Flat. She was transferred to a medical helicopter and flown to Modesto Me-\nmorial Hospital. Unfortunately, she passed away in the emergency room.\n\nANALYSIS\nWhile a climb like Cathedral Peak is not particularly difficult, move for move, it\nis every bit as serious as any other alpine rock climb. Loose rock abounds in the\nHigh Sierra, and it\u2019s important to test holds and be aware of your surroundings and\nclimbers above and below you at all times.\n    While it\u2019s hard to know if\u2014or to what extent\u2014crowding on the route contrib-\nuted to this accident, crowds are a common and dangerous problem on trade\nroutes like Cathedral Peak. In addition to increased rockfall hazard, people\u2019s\nrisk analysis, route choices, and the length of time on route can all be affected\nby having too many people in a small area. If there are too many people, con-\nsider another objective or waiting for another day.\n    The leaders of the party had knowledge of self-rescue systems (which helped\ntremendously), but they also struggled a bit when it came time to execute them.\nThe amount of chaos and adrenaline in a scenario like this is tremendous. Without\nknowledge and practice, it will be extremely difficult to get things done efficiently.\n(In this case, the most efficient way to lower the patient likely would have been for\nBen to anchor Erin at the belay ledge, release the autoblocked belay device\u00ad\u2014with a\nbackup\u2014and lower Megan directly to the ground. But the two leaders in the group\nwere focused on reaching their injured friend as quickly as possible.\n    By acting hastily, the results can be catastrophic (such as the blown anchor)\nor simply add time and complexity to the rescue. Take a deep breath and analyze\nyour surroundings. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat is necessary? Who is necessary? What is\nour goal?\u201d Remember: \u201cSlow is smooth, smooth is fast.\u201d (Source: Yosemite National\nPark Climbing Rangers.)\n",

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience\nMammoth Lakes, Clark Canyon, Area 13\nOn July 25, as he was preparing to lower from a ledge, a climber fell about 15 meters\nto the ground. The climber was a member of a three-person team attempting a\n\u201cmock multi-pitch climb\u201d in preparation for a real multi-pitch objective later in the\nweek. Climber 1 (male, age unknown, with moderate experience) conducted this\npractice session with Climber 2 (male, age 32) and Climber 3 (female, age 40). Both\nClimber 2 and Climber 3 had little outdoor climbing experience.\n    Before the fall, Climber 1 led up a climb (believed to be Chop Chop, 5.8) to a sin-\ngle bolt at a ledge approximately 15 meters up. He used this bolt as a belay anchor\nto bring up the other climbers. Before climbing, Climber 2 tied into the middle of\nthe rope using a figure 8 on a bight clipped to his harness with a locking carabiner,\nand Climber 3 tied into the end of the rope.\n    Climber 2, still clipped into the rope via a figure 8 on a bight, attempted to\nlead the bolted climb above the ledge (Pachuco, 5.8) as the second pitch of their\nroute. He was able to climb to the next bolt but felt \u201csketched out\u201d and asked to\nbe lowered to the ledge. Once there, Climber 2 asked to be lowered to the ground.\nClimber 2 recalled that, \u201cthe rope was a mess, with loops everywhere.\u201d\n    Concerned that he wouldn\u2019t have enough rope to lower Climber 2 from the bolt\nclipped on the route above, Climber 1 attached a second belay device to his har-\nness, then redirected what he believed to be a length of rope leading to Climbing\n2\u2019s knot through the anchor. Just as Climber 2 leaned back, Climber 1 realized that\nhe was belaying \u201cjust a random loop\u201d and Climber 2 fell to the ground.\n    Nearby climbers with medical experience and an AMGA-certified guide\nheard the scream of Climber 2 and came to assist. They stabilized Climber 2,\nwho had a suspected spine injury and right forearm fracture, and called 911.\nClimber 1 and Climber 3 were shaken by the fall and were unable to self-rescue.\nThe guide, belayed by another climber, ascended to their position and assisted\nthem to the ground. Climber 1 sustained moderate rope burns to the inside\nof one hand, while Climber 3 sustained partial- and full-thickness rope burns\nexposing the \u201cfatty\u201d layer across her forearms and biceps. (Source: RL, climber\nwho assisted in the rescue.)\n\nANALYSIS\nClimber 1 said after the accident that this was the first time he had used the mock\nmulti-pitch method of teaching and he was \u201ccoming up with most of it on the fly.\u201d\nHe remarked that it quickly became \u201cway too complicated.\u201d\n    When climbers are standing on a ledge, as in this instance, it can be difficult\nto identify the correct strands of rope to use for belaying, rappelling, or lower-\ning, as none of them may be weighted. This makes the fundamentals of such\ntransitions all the more essential. Climbers should be secured to an anchor\nprior to transitioning to another rope, and then should weight-test the rappel\nor lowering system before unclipping from the anchor.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Communication and Teamwork\nHigh Sierra, Palisades, Starlight Peak\nOn August 6, a party of two was descending from Starlight Peak (14,200 feet) after\nclimbing the Starlight Buttress route. Both climbers were experienced but unfamiliar\nwith this particular area. They had planned to descend the northwest ridge to the\nUnderhill Couloir between Starlight and Thunderbolt Peaks and then to the glacier.\n    While descending, the party deviated from their planned route. Climber 1 (male,\n66) believed he had located a gully that could be scrambled down after an initial\nsteep section, and requested that Climber 2 (female, 45) set up a rappel to start\n                                                           down this gully.

Jeff Mekolites             The climbers completed sev-\n                                                          eral rappels down the gully be-\nfore falling rock and difficulty constructing anchors caused them to leave the gully\nand begin rappelling diagonally across the neighboring face, leaving gear and natu-\nral (sling) anchors. Although they were unaware of it, the climbers were rappelling\njust right of the climb known as \u201cthe X.\u201d The Secor guidebook to the Sierra says,\n\u201cThis is probably the most dangerous route in the Palisades,\u201d because of loose rock.\n    Sometime in late afternoon, Climber 2 set a rappel anchor on the face, slinging\na horn with webbing, and began rappelling. When Climber 2 was about 30 to 40\nfeet down the rappel, the anchor failed and both climbers fell, coming to a stop\nwhen the rope snagged on an unknown feature. Climber 1 was killed in the fall.\nClimber 2, who was not seriously injured, was crouched on a small ledge, tangled\nin the rope, with Climber 1 hanging below. Climber 2 managed to access an emer-\ngency locator beacon in her pack and activated it at this time.\n    Climber 2 had minimal gear available, as the majority was with her partner.\nShe was unable to anchor herself and initially unwilling to move, due to the risk of\nbeing dragged off the ledge by the weight of Climber 1. After assessing the situa-\ntion, she decided her position was too unstable to spend the night there without\nslipping and potentially dislodging the rope. She determined there were two load-\nbearing lengths keeping the rope tight: one tangled around her leg, pulling upward\nbehind her to the unknown snag, and the other going downward from her jammed\nrappel device to Climber 1 hanging below. The strategy she implemented was to\ncut a long cord in two and use the two halves to attach a prusik knot to each of\nthe load-bearing lengths of rope, connecting them loosely with a sling. She then\ncarefully slid the prusik knot on the lower rope downward until she could transfer\nClimber 1\u2019s weight onto the prusik tied to the snagged rope. She was then able to\nremove herself from the weighted system, remove the jammed rappel device from\nthe rope, and untangle herself from the remaining strands of rope.\n    Climber 2 climbed up to a larger ledge, about 20 feet above, where she tied\n herself to a boulder and remained through the night. Early the following morning\n(August 7), Climber 2 used the strobe on her emergency locator beacon to signal a\nguide and clients when they awoke at their nearby camp, and this party made their\nway across the glacier to where they could communicate. The guide called 911.\n    Helicopters from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and California\nHighway Patrol located Climber 2 but were unable to rescue her that afternoon.\nInyo County Search and Rescue determined the area was too dangerous to access\nby climbing or rappel and requested assistance from Yosemite Search and Rescue.\nA YOSAR team arrived that evening by helicopter and rescued Climber 2 via a long\nline, after she\u2019d spent 26 hours on the ledge. The YOSAR helicopter returned on\nAugust 8 to retrieve the body of Climber 1.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe immediate cause of this accident was that the final anchor set by Climber 2\nfailed. The difficulty of finding anchors, the lateness of the day, and the shortage of\ngear available for the descent led the party to rely on a natural anchor on unknown\nterrain, without a backup. Although it appeared solid and was tested before start-\ning the rappel, it is likely the horn was not solidly attached to the rock. It is also\npossible the failure was due to other reasons, such as incorrectly tied webbing.\n    While the anchor failure was the immediate cause, the disagreement and deci-\nsion to leave the standard route precipitated the event. Both parties should have\nassessed and discussed the proposed deviation from the standard descent before\neither climber began rappelling. (Source: Anonymous report from Climber 2.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience, Inadequate Belay\nSanta Monica Mountains, Echo Cliff\nOn December 3, my climbing partners Dave and Sam and a newly introduced third\npartner, Johnny, met up at Echo Cliffs and hiked to the crag called Easy Street. We\nsplit into teams of two, setting up ropes alongside each other. Dave and I began on\nCharlie Hustle (5.10a), while Sam and Johnny climbed Casey at the Bat (5.10b). Dave,\na much stronger and more experienced climber than me, led our pitch. We were in\ndirect sun and were all quickly drenched in sweat.\n    I successfully top-roped the route, feeling good and strong, and we decided to\nswitch routes with Johnny and Sam. \u201cYou should lead this one, Sarah. I think you\u2019d\nreally like it,\u201d Sam told me as we transitioned. I hesitated, but my ego cushioned my\nnerves and I agreed to lead. Though I had been introduced to climbing as a child, I\nhad just started to get serious about climbing four months prior to this trip. I had\nled a number of sport routes but had never taken a lead fall.\n    As I began the route, clipping the first three bolts, I began to feel more confident.\nAt the third bolt, on a roof, I moved right using a ledge below. I took my time to feel for\nthe best holds and calculate my moves over the roof. Dave had given me some slack,\nand I noticed that there was too much out, considering the ledge below. I felt inclined\nto voice this concern, but at that moment someone passed by and caught Dave\u2019s at-\ntention. Instead of interjecting for the sake of my safety and success, I decided to\nmake the move. I reached with my left hand onto a positive but greasy hold, and as\n my weight transferred onto it I fell. The slack in the rope from the traverse and excess\ndown at the belay resulted in a fall of 10 to 12 feet, past the ledge and onto an outwardly\ncurved rock just below. My right foot took the complete force of the fall.\n    With the help of my partners, who piggybacked me much of the way, we made\nit back to the parking lot. The next day, I was diagnosed with a fractured right talus\nthat required surgery, leaving me with a five-inch incision, two screws, and one\nplate to stabilize the fractured pieces of my ankle.\n\nANALYSIS\nAs a novice leader, I was naive when it came to observing fall lines, the risks in-\nvolved in roofs and ledges, and the effects of the warmer weather. I was also inse-\ncure when it came to voicing my concerns to my belay partner when it was crucial\nto do so. Plus, my belayer was distracted during a crucial part of my climb. The be-\nlayer should always be \u201cwith me,\u201d with eyes focused on my climb and assessing risk\nfrom his/her viewpoint. In addition, none of us had a first-aid kit. A helpful climber\noffered me some anti-inflammatory medicine before we hiked out, but having NSAIDs\nof our own and splinting supplies would have been helpful. (Source: Sarah Trudeau.)\n    Editor\u2019s note: Falling is a part of sport climbing and is a learned skill. Though it might\nnot have prevented this injury, practicing short leader falls in a safe environment (such\nas a gym), with an experienced mentor, can help novice climbers learn to take relaxed\nfalls with feet and legs prepared to absorb impacts.",

This helped greatly, as he was able to\nmaneuver himself to the edge of the ledge so I could lower him to the belay atop\nthe first pitch, and from there, pull the rope, rethread it, and lower him to the\nground. It is also fortunate that Anders is a big, tough Swede because his injuries\nwere horrific: a compound dislocation of his ankle, in which his lower leg bones\nbroke through the skin.\n    Fortune smiled on the unfortunate yet again because we had cell phone service.\nWe were just outside Rocky Mountain National Park, and the first responders to\narrive were from the Park Service, about 2.5 hours after our call. Soon thereafter,\nvolunteers from Rocky Mountain Rescue Group and Larimer County Search and\nRescue reached us. A helicopter rescue was needed to evacuate Anders. (This crag\nis about an hour from the parking area on unimproved climbers\u2019 trails and steep\ntalus.) An Army Blackhawk was flown in from Eagle, Colorado, and about 6.5 hours\nafter our call for help, Anders was flown to a waiting ambulance in Estes Park.\n\n\n ANALYSIS\nWith approximately 80 feet of rope out, there was too much stretch in the rope and\ntoo little protection, given the looming ledge below. I felt minimal force from the\nfall at the belay. Would a higher piece have prevented this accident, and if so, how\nmuch higher? Could a higher piece even have been placed? All good questions that\nAnders cannot answer. [Editor\u2019s note: The only guidebook to this area was published\nbefore this route was established. The route is on Mountain Project, but the descrip-\ntion of the climbing above the ledge is vague.] We were fortunate to have a phone to\ncall for help. In remote areas, where cell service might not be available, carrying a\nSpot or similar device should be considered.

His\ntwo companions continued with their attempt, and, after discovering the man\u2019s ve-\nhicle still in the parking area that evening, they reported him missing. His body was\nfound halfway up the Loft route, which often requires technical mountaineering in\nwinter; the cause of death was not reported, but was likely a fall from snow or ice.\n    On September 30, a 66-year-old man died as a result of injuries from a fall re-\nported to be 50 feet long at Batman Pinnacle on Lumpy Ridge. The climber was on\nBatman and Robin (5.6), whose first pitch does not follow an obvious well-protected\nline and has been the scene of a number of accidents.\n    At the end of October, a 31-year-old woman suffered life-threatening injuries from\nrockfall on Martha, a moderate mixed couloir on the south face of Mt. Lady Washing-\nton. She was lowered several hundred feet to the bottom of the climb and then down\ntalus to a point where she could be hoisted into a helicopter. Martha is a very popular\nroute, with both natural rockfall hazard and danger from other climbers; it generally\nhas better snow and ice coverage later in the season.\n    In another incident, a 28-year-old man was injured in a ledge fall 700 feet up the\nPetit Grepon in August; climbers and rangers lowered him to the base of the spire,\nwhere he received advanced care from a park paramedic. The climber spent the night\nthere with rescuers and then was lowered down 1,000 feet of talus to Sky Pond, where\nhe could board a rescue helicopter.

She spun to the left and fell toward\nthe rock face, hitting her head and left side. However, the belayer was able to hold\nonto the brake strand, keeping the climber from falling very far.

We were scouting locations for an\nupcoming practice session, as we both vol-\nunteer for Rocky Mountain Rescue Group. I\nsaw the climber bounce several times, then\nfall out of sight. I called 911 to report an es-\ntimated 60- to 70-foot fall and let dispatch\nknow a technical rescue would be needed.\n    When we reached the scene, the climber\nwas suspended on his rope about three feet\noff the ground, unconscious and bloodied.\nA bystander cut the rope with a knife, and\nthe injured climber was lowered by several\n                                                 The Dome in Boulder Canyon. A climber fell\npeople to the ground. The climber, age 27,\n                                                 from near the top to the approximate area\nregained consciousness after several min- marked by the arrow. John Hegyes\nutes. He was loaded in a litter and carried\ndown the Dome approach trail, and was in an ambulance less than an hour after\nthe accident occurred. He ended up with multiple injuries, including a concussion,\nwicked road rash, and some fractures, but no surgeries. I ran into him at a local pub\n(using crutches and with a neck brace) about a week later!\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climber, who had some experience, was with two beginners. He had\nclimbed East of the Sun (5.7) and was planning to set up a top-rope on the\nEast Slab using his single rope. After building an anchor, he leaned back to\nlower, but he had been taken off belay. The climber bounced down the entire\nslab until, miraculously, an overhand knot in the end of the rope caught in a\ncarabiner clipped to his first piece of protection. I don\u2019t know if this knot was\nplaced intentionally, but this piece, a wired nut about 30 feet off the deck,\nkept him from hitting the ground.\n    When talking with him later in the pub, the climber accepted responsibility for\nwhat had happened, as he was the most experienced one there. He did not remem-\nber the fall or the rescue. The party\u2019s inexperience resulted in a classic communi-\ncation error: The climber was taken off belay before being lowered.\n   Before leaving the ground, the climber should always explain to the belayer\nhis or her plan for when the pitch is completed (lower, rappel, bring up the next\nclimber, etc.). The belayer must not take the climber off belay without audible or\nvisual confirmation that the climber is anchored and off belay. (Sources: Dr. Alison\nSheets and the Editors.)\n\nMORE BOULDER CANYON ACCIDENTS: In March, a woman was lowered off the\nend of her rope on Frothing Green at the Bowling Alley, suffering a head laceration\nin a tumbling fall. The pitch is obviously long and is best climbed with a 70-meter\nrope (some route descriptions warn of this), and a stopper knot in the belayer\u2019s end\nof the rope would have prevented this accident. At the end of May, a climber took\na reported 50-foot fall at Tonnere Tower; fortunately, a tree broke his fall, but his\ninjuries still necessitated a difficult evacuation. In June, a 29-year-old woman fell\nfrom the tricky-to-protect first pitch of Cosmosis (5.10a) at Bell Buttress; a nut and\nsmall cam pulled out, and she hit the belay ledge 20 to 25 feet below, breaking an\nankle and possibly vertebrae.",

        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Clip Anchor\nEldorado Canyon, The Bastille\nOn May 12, 27-year-old Conor Felletter and his climbing partner, Kelly Kochanski,\nwere climbing Werk Supp, a two-pitch 5.9 route. After completing the first pitch,\nFelletter decided to head over to the Bastille Crack, a popular five-pitch 5.7 that\nalready had another party on it. He climbed an easy gully for 80 feet to join the\nfourth pitch of the Bastille Crack. Continuing up that pitch, Felletter passed the\ntraditional belay stance, already occupied by the other party, and began to set up\nan anchor higher and to the left. He placed one solid cam but did not clip it right\naway, focusing instead on placing a second piece for his anchor. Before he could\nplace the second piece, he slipped.\n    Felletter fell 40 feet, flipping upside down and hitting his head on a rock, which\nsplit his helmet and gashed his forehead. He was unresponsive at first but regained\nconsciousness and motioned for Kochanski to lower him to a ledge. Another climb-\ner reached the ledge and helped Kochanski secure Felletter. This second climber\nalso called 911. The patient stated that his neck hurt, and he was drifting in and out\nof consciousness.\n    Rocky Mountain Rescue Group (RMRG) responded within the hour, rappelling\nto the climbers\u2019 position from the top of the Bastille. After evaluating Felletter\u2019s\ninjuries and stabilizing him, a lowering system was rigged. Felletter was secured\nin a litter and lowered to the ground and a waiting ambulance. He suffered seven\nbroken vertebrae in his neck, three broken ribs, a torn elbow ligament, many lac-\nerations, and moderate brain trauma. He attributes being alive to his helmet and\nthe quick response of the RMRG.\n ANALYSIS\nThe place where Felletter attempted to set up\nhis anchor was dirtier and wetter than the main\nroute, and it is possible he slipped on loose de-\nbris. Although some climbers like to complete\nan anchor before clipping in (perhaps waiting\nuntil they have a master point linked to all the\nanchor components), it requires no significant\ntime or effort to temporarily clove-hitch the rope\nto your first solid anchor piece or clip your per-\nsonal tether to it. Rescuers noted that Felletter\u2019s\nfirst piece was good and likely would have held\nhis slip.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled Out\nEldorado Canyon, Rincon Wall\nOn March 27, Japhy Dhungana (32), Eric Whewell, and Rainbow Weinstock were\nclimbing at the Rincon Wall, projecting single-pitch trad-climbing routes. All three\nare very experienced climbers; each is an AMGA-certified rock guide. Each person\nhad a separate project he was working in \u201cheadpoint\u201d style. It was Japhy\u2019s second\nday attempting the Evictor (5.12d R), and he had practiced his gear placements and\nclimbing beta, including successfully top-roping the route while \u201cmock-placing\u201d\ngear along the way. After five attempts that day, three of which were successful\nsends on top-rope, Japhy began a lead attempt late in the day, around 4 p.m.\n   Japhy started up the route with just the right gear on his harness. The lower\none-third of this climb is considered the \u201csafety crux,\u201d with sparse gear placements\nover challenging climbing, and this section was dispatched without trouble. At the\nhalfway mark, there is one horizontal crack with a decent rest. At this horizontal\ncrack, Japhy placed number 0.75 and 0.5 Black Diamond Ultralight Camalots adja-\ncent to each other, equalized by a single quickdraw clipped to both of the cams. This\nhorizontal crack offered the best protection on the whole route, and the two cams\nnested together created a \u201cmini-anchor\u201d that would help protect the upper climb.\n   Above this horizontal crack, the \u201credpoint crux\u201d is a long sequence of sparsely\nprotected 5.12 moves. In a shallow crack, Japhy placed a 0.4 Ultralight Camalot and\na 0.75 Ultralight Camalot. Both placements were good, but due to the shallowness\nand shape of the crack, they were not very deep and the stems could not be ori-\nented toward the direction of load (i.e., they were pointing outward from the ver-\n tical crack). Japhy climbed past the crux moves and reached for the finishing jug,\nwhere a bomber nut could be placed. At this point, he was about 10 feet above the\nlast piece of protection (the 0.75 Camalot). He could not control the final jug and\nslipped off, expecting to take a 25- to 30-foot fall. Instead, he landed on the ground\nnext to his belayer after a 70-foot ground fall. Four pieces of gear had ripped from\ntheir placements, and the belayer never felt the rope come under tension.\n    Although Japhy suffered significant injuries (fractured pelvis, fractured sacrum,\nfractured lumbar spine, concussion, and significant internal bleeding), he was soon\nable to return to climbing and working as a guide. His helmet likely protected him\nfrom a more serious head injury. He is grateful to all of the rescue personnel and is\nglad to be able to continue climbing with more humility and experience.\n\nANALYSIS\nUpon significant reflection, it seems highly likely that the upper pieces pulled out\nafter rotating in their shallow placements due to the strong downward force of a\nleader fall applied to the stiff stems of the cams. Japhy knew these the upper pieces\nwere not 100 percent, which is why he had doubled up the pieces just below.\n    The real surprise in this incident is the failure of the two pieces of protection in\nthe horizontal crack. These were in a deep crack in good rock. They were placed\nnext to each other, well seated, and within a good camming range. They were so\nclose to each other that they could be clipped with a single quickdraw. Yet both\ncams ripped\u2014the rope did not come unclipped from the rope-end carabiner. Al-\nthough this is speculation, it seems likely that the high force of the fall may have\ncaused one of the two nested cams to knock the other one out of position, much\nlike a bowling ball hitting pins. It is worth wondering: Would placing just one of\nthese cams have been safer? It\u2019s also possible that the smooth rock inside this\nclimb\u2019s cracks may have affected the cams\u2019 holding power.\n    Another speculative possibility is that Ultralight Camalots, with their narrower\ncam lobes and slightly stiffer plastic housing, may not have been the right choice\nfor this route. A camming unit with a more flexible stem, especially in the upper\ntwo placements, might have been less likely to pull out. A lesson here is that having\na range of protection options, and not just relying on one style of cam, could help\nprotect complex routes such as this, where precise gear beta is essential.\n    Finally, headpoint-style climbs like this are dangerous, and large lead falls on\ntraditional gear can have unpredictable results. A more fastidious selection of\ncamming devices appropriate to the route, not attempting to lead the route after a\nfull day of climbing, and perhaps testing the critical gear placements before a lead\nattempt would all be good strategies for climbs like this.

In one case, deteriorating weather likely was a\nfactor, as rain and snow moved in during the man\u2019s climb. The accessible, low-angle\nslabs of the Flatirons frequently lure inexperienced or ill-prepared scramblers (in-\ncluding those with inadequate footwear) into dangerous positions, forcing rescues.\n",

While descending from\nthe top of the second pitch, the climber was lowered off the end of the rope,\nresulting in a ground fall of approximately 25 feet.

The climber was told by multiple people that the two pitches of\nthis climb could be linked and lowered using a 70-meter rope.

However, while seconding the route just prior to\nthe one where the accident occurred, the belayer untied the stopper knot in order\nto tie in to her harness. After completing that route, she pulled the rope and the\nstopper knot was not replaced. Neither party caught the error.\n    It also may have been a factor that the belayer climbed primarily indoors and\nwas not in the habit of placing stopper knots or otherwise closing the system. As a\nclimber, checking the stopper knot should be part of your pre-climb ritual, just as\nyou would check your knot and make sure you\u2019re on belay. Use this habit indoors\nto ingrain it into your practice.\n    Belayer failed to keep track of the end of the rope, thus allowing it to pass\nthrough the belay device.

As\nhe moved toward the summit, he either slipped on a loose rock or fell through a\nsmall cornice, and in an instant he started falling down the east face, a legendary\nextreme ski run.

By simul-climbing most of the route, the pair was able to\nreduce the total pitches from 13 to eight.\n    On the seventh pitch, the climbers encountered a 5.7 roof with loose blocks,\nwhich they had expected based on photos and route beta. The female climber took\nthe lead, moving up the low-angle face and placing a few pieces before the roof.\nShe noticed a few small rocks being knocked off by the rope above her belayer, so\nshe moved left in hopes that rockfall would not hit her partner. She placed a num-\nber 0.3 Camalot X4 and stepped up approximately five feet to reach the roof. As she\nmade her first move onto the roof, some blocky rocks collapsed and she tumbled\ndown along with head- to computer-size boulders.\n    The belay held, but the climber\u2019s right foot was pinned beneath some of the\nfallen rocks. She trundled the rocks off her foot and was able to stand on the slope.\nHer belayer lowered her to a flat spot and they taped up abrasions and lacerations\non her fingers, arms, and face. Although in pain, she was able to continue climbing\nwith the injured ankle. The pair finished the route and descended via the standard\nnortheast ridge (Knife Edge) route, staying roped up for the fourth-class sections.\n\nANALYSIS\nCapitol Peak is known for loose rock, even on the relatively solid Northwest But-\ntress. The leader may have climbed into an area of the roof that was less stable\nthan the more frequently climbed section a few feet to the right. Instead of moving\noff-route, the team might have been able to relocate the belay or link pitches to\nprotect the belayer from potential rockfall. However, they said, they were belaying\nfrom bolted anchors and had limited options. The climber knocked on the blocks\nin the roof prior to stepping up and said they seemed sufficiently stable. \u201cBesides\nbeing super-cautious, I\u2019m not sure how else the accident could have been avoided,\u201d\nshe said.

The normal route (the 4th-class Knife Edge) side of the ridge between K2 and the\nis near the left skyline. Several climbers have died Knife Edge, the 4th-class crux of the\nattempting shortcuts down this very steep face.\n                                                     climb. Shull, an experienced climber,\nwas with three friends, but he was ahead and out of sight when he fell. He fell into a\n\u201ccrevasse\u201d and was confirmed dead later that day by an MRA volunteer. The recov-\nery effort, postponed several days by bad weather, was extensive and dangerous\ndue to the location of the body.\n    On August 22, the bodies of Aspen couple Carlin Brightwell (27) and Ryan Marcil\n(26) were found at the base of the northwest face of Capitol. They were last seen in\nlate morning of August 20, very near the summit. It\u2019s not known what caused their\nfall, but according to Jesse Steindler, a deputy with the Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Of-\nfice, the couple may have tried to descend an alternative route from the top.\n    On August 26, Zackaria White (21) fell approximately 600 feet while descending\nthe mountain. White and his climbing partner, Brandon Wilhelm, had argued over\nwhich route to take down the mountain. White, with little previous climbing expe-\nrience, wanted to try an apparent direct descent from the top down a gully to the\nnorth. Wilhelm, who had climbed 42 of Colorado\u2019s 14ers, advised against leaving the\nstandard route and warned White that the shortcut would cliff out. The pair sepa-\nrated before the Knife Edge around 4:45 p.m., approximately an hour after reach-\ning the summit, and White began to descend the gully. Wilhelm continued down\nthe standard route and reached Capitol Lake around 7 p.m. He searched for White\nuntil he could no longer see in the darkness. White\u2019s body was found the next day.\n\nANALYSIS\nFour fatalities had occurred on Capitol Peak over the preceding 14 years before\nthe spike in 2017. Capitol Peak is not a beginner climb and should not be attempt-\ned unless the climber has extensive Class 4 mountaineering experience. Climbers\nshould build their capability patiently, creating a solid foundation. Climbing peaks\n with an experienced mentor or hiring a guide service can help with skill develop-\nment and understanding personal limitations.\n    As many as four out of the five climbers who died on Capitol in 2017 were\noff-route, demonstrating that an important step in preparation is to thoroughly\nresearch the planned ascent and descent. In addition to printed guidebooks, re-\nsources such as 14ers.com provide extensive route information, photos, and com-\nments on route-finding and current conditions from fellow climbers. From the top\nof Capitol Peak, it appears there is a more direct route back to Capitol Lake, the\nstart of the climb. According to Justin Hood, president of MRA, this descent be-\ncomes progressively steeper on loose talus and scree, ending with an unavoidable\n300-foot cliff band. It can also be very difficult to return this way once climbers\nrealize they cannot continue down.\n    Most climbers attempting Capitol do not bring harnesses, rope, and a rack. But\nwith loose rock and high exposure, the consequences of a misstep are high. Knowl-\nedgeable climbers can safeguard the most exposed sections of this climb with a\nshort rope and very little additional equipment (see Know the Ropes on page 8).\n    Along with appropriate experience and preparation, climbers must use good\njudgment. \u201cEveryone is in charge of their own decisions,\u201d said MRA\u2019s Hood. \u201cOften-\ntimes, there is an expectation that you have to summit, because you took the time\noff of work, got on the plane, rented the car, lugged the equipment and camped,\nand want the Instagram shot. If you can be in the moment and let go of your expec-\ntation to summit, you will make better, safer decisions.\u201d\n    To respond to the increase of mountaineering accidents in the region, the Na-\ntional Forest Service, MRA, and Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office are organizing work-\nshops to educate climbers on mountain safety. Partnering with Aspen Alpine Guides\nand Aspen Expeditions, they will focus on techniques that will help climbers navigate\nthe unique hazards of the Elk Mountains. See mountainrescueaspen.org.",

        "Incident_Type": "FALL FROM ANCHOR",
        "Details_Factors": "Communication Problems\nDurango Area, Lemon Reservoir\nThad Ferrell and I arrived at Lemon Reservoir in the upper Florida River Valley\naround 8 a.m. on September 9. It\u2019s about a 15-minute hike in, followed by a 20-foot\ndownclimb into the canyon. We did three warm-up routes, all sport climbs. I led\neach of the routes first, followed by Thad. At the top of each route, he would clip in\nand give me a thumbs-up, and then set up a rappel and rap down. We used verbal\ncommands, but we couldn\u2019t hear each other because of the river running by us.\n    We next headed over to a 5.12- called Holy Grail. We decided to wear helmets\nbecause there was a slight chance of hitting a ledge about two-thirds of the way up.\nI climbed first, putting up the draws. I fell at the crux and wanted to do the route\nagain. However, just as Thad started climbing, two other climbers, George and Ian,\ntold us they also wanted to do the route. We briefly discussed this, but as Thad start-\ned up we still hadn\u2019t determined if I was going to climb the route again. I remember\nthinking that I should remind Thad to leave the quickdraws in place on his way down.\nSaying something likely would have prevented the accident, because we both would\nhave been on the same page about what was going to happen at the anchor.\n     Thad sent the route. Shortly thereafter, he gave me the thumbs-up and I took\nhim off belay, the same steps we had followed on all three previous routes. Soon\nafter this, he fell. I dove out of the way because Ian and George were yelling \u201crock!\u201d\nThad landed with a terrible thud. It was the worst moment of my life.\n    Ian and George immediately ran to him. Down the trail about 100 feet, a dozen\nor so climbers were across the river, and they shouted to me that they were going\nto run out and call for help. Someone else had a SPOT device and activated it im-\nmediately. Two other men, Chas and a second Ian, ran over to the scene. And then\nI collapsed and two women came across the river to sit with me.\n    Thad was unconscious for eight minutes. I thought he was dead. But one of the\nIans came over to tell me he was breathing and likely didn\u2019t have a spinal injury.\n(George, the two Ians, and Chas all had Wilderness First Responder training.) Thad\nstarted moving fairly quickly after he regained consciousness, but was clearly in\nterrible shape. He was extremely disoriented. His helmet was broken.\n    Rescuers showed up within the hour, followed shortly by Flight for Life. They\norganized people to get him across the river and up to the helicopter. I left with\nRosie to call Thad\u2019s wife.\n    Thad was flown to the local hospital and then to St. Anthony\u2019s in Denver, where\nhe had a bunch of surgeries. He sustained numerous traumatic injuries, the most\nserious being a shattered jaw. The four first responders had saved his life by keep-\ning his airway clear. Because he had no serious brain or spine injuries, Thad will\nrecover almost fully. He was already walking a couple of months after the accident.\n\nANALYSIS\nDespite both of us having 20-plus years of experience in all realms of climbing\n(trad, sport, bouldering, ice, alpine), we didn\u2019t clearly communicate about what\nThad was going to do at the belay while we were on the ground. We were sport\nclimbing and nonchalant about it. What went right:\n    (1) WFR-trained people were there within seconds of the fall.\n    (2) Someone across the river had a SPOT device and could call for help al-\nmost immediately.\n    (3) We wore helmets.\n    (4) Thad is a mutant.\n    When he gave me the thumbs-up at the anchor, I thought he was off belay\nand planned to rappel, just as he had earlier. He does not remember anything\nabout the accident. I surmise that he was thinking he was going to leave the quick-\ndraws on the route for George and Ian and simply lower off the draws I had left at\nthe anchor. He was still tied into his end of the rope, and the rope fell to the ground\nwith him.\n     My WFR certification had expired 20 years earlier, so I wasn\u2019t equipped to help\nThad after the fall, except to take notes on his vitals. Had the four first responders\nnot been there, I am not sure he would have survived.\n    I feel extreme guilt for not being able to help and for taking him off belay. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter how many people tell me it was an accident or that it wasn\u2019t my\nfault. I feel responsible, at least in part. I don\u2019t know how people deal with stuff like\nthis without seeing a trauma therapist. (Source: Lizzy Scully.)",

The climber, who was attempting to flash the\nroute, had progressed to just below the seventh bolt. He clipped a quickdraw to the\nbolt and pulled up slack a number of times in an attempt to clip the rope, but each\ntime dropped it. The belayer could tell he was getting close to the failure point.\n    With the rope in his hand, the leader yelled \u201ctake!\u201d and the belayer, hoping the\nleader had managed to clip the seventh bolt, took in an arm\u2019s length of slack and\nthen saw a \u201cbunch\u201d more rope fall toward him. The belayer moved backward, about\n10 feet away from the cliff, without the rope coming taut.

The men had climbed ice before but the woman, who borrowed ice climb-\ning equipment from the festival, was a beginner.\n    Planning to top-rope, they rappelled about 25 meters down to a belay behind\nthe pillar, where an icy ledge had formed high above the shore of Lake Superior.\nThe woman was unable to complete the climb. Partway up, she decided it would\nbe easier to ascend the climbing rope. She was carrying ascenders and success-\nfully transitioned to ascending but was unable to make it to the top. Deciding to\ntry climbing again, she began to transition back to a rappel to return to the ledge.\nDuring this transition, she fell about seven meters and landed on the belay ledge.\nShe complained of substantial pain in her pelvis (which turned out to be bruised\nbut not fractured).\n    The trio attempted to self-rescue from the top but were unable to get her out.\n It was a warm day (about 30\u00b0F), but they\nwere starting to get cold. They had ra-\ndios and called 911. The Coast Guard flew\nout a helicopter and put a rescuer onto\nthe 45\u00b0 ice slope at the base of the cliff,\nbut the rescuer did not have crampons\nand was unable to climb the ice to the\nbelay ledge.\n    Ice Fest leaders then organized a\nteam of four professional climbers and\nguides to assist with the rescue.

I am very familiar with\nRed Rock Canyon, having climbed there for a few weeks a year since 2014, when I\n took the American Alpine Institute (AAI) courses \u201cIntensive Intro to Rock Climbing\u201d\nand \u201cLearn To Lead.\u201d\n    On February 7, we headed to the Red Spring area, started with a few routes on\nCowlick Crag, then headed over to Dickies Cliff. The route we chose was Guys and\nGhouls (100\u2019, 5.6), which I had top-roped during one of the AAI courses. Because of\nmy injuries, I don\u2019t recall the details of the climb and fall. Here is what I have put\ntogether based on discussions with witnesses.\n    I started leading up the route and put in a small cam (approximately 0.4 Cama-\nlot) about 15 feet off the deck. I pulled a small roof and continued up 10 to 12 feet\nabove my cam. At this point I fell. I don\u2019t know why, and neither do the people who\nsaw the fall. No one saw a hold break.\n    Initially, Paul caught my fall. But then some bad things happened. First, the\nforce of the catch (I dropped over 20 feet) and the sudden and forceful upward\npull of the harness on my skin caused a bad subcutaneous degloving injury to my\nbackside (specifically a Morel-Lavall\u00e9e lesion of the posterior iliac region).\n    Second, the micro-cam at 15 feet, after initially holding a force powerful enough\nto seriously injure me, pulled out. I dropped the remaining five or six feet to the\nbase of the climb, then bounced another 10 feet below that into a rocky gully. My\nhead impacted the rock several times, causing skull fractures and a traumatic brain\ninjury.\n    A wilderness first responder named Jason saw the fall and came running to\nhelp. Jason described me as \u201cunconscious and unresponsive,\u201d with bleeding from\nthe nose and ears. He and Paul called for a rescue and watched over me until a\nhelicopter came and the EMTs took me to the hospital.\n\nANALYSIS\nI was on a route I had climbed three years earlier, and I am certain it was well\nwithin my ability. I will never understand how I could have fallen where I did, but\nsometimes climbers fall. (Maybe I stepped on a banana peel!) I would say the big-\ngest takeaway is the adage, \u201cAlways have at least two pieces between you and the\nground.\u201d\n   Some people have mentioned the possibility of the belayer employing a \u201csoft\ncatch\u201d as something that might have prevented the cam from pulling. But my\nconclusion is that my belayer made the correct choice in this situation. Given\nthe distance I had climbed above the cam, a ground fall was definitely a possible\noutcome, and the belayer\u2019s primary concern is to keep the climber from hitting\nthe ground.\n   Although it had rained a tiny bit two or three days before the accident, I don\u2019t\nbelieve this had any impact on the rock quality or the cam placement. It was a fairly\nsmall Camalot, so maybe this was a case of over-reliance on a small cam. I would\npoint out, in my defense, that the piece held temporarily with enough force to give\nme a nasty injury, so it wasn\u2019t a completely useless placement.\n   I\u2019m sure that wearing a helmet is among the reasons I survived the fall. I recom-\nmend it. (Source: Greg Smith, age 53.)\n   Editor\u2019s note: Greg Smith describes this incident in depth during episode 28 of the\nAAC\u2019s Sharp End podcast.\n",

        "Incident_Type": "NEW HAMPSHIRE\nFALL ON ICE",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Tool Placements\nCannon Cliff, Black Dike\nOn February 4, a team of climbers from Amherst, Massachusetts, was ascending\nthe third and final pitch of the Black Dike (WI4 M3), Cannon Cliff\u2019s most popular\nice climb. As the leader (male, age 47) moved up the final ice before the route turns\nto n\u00e9v\u00e9, both of his tools popped and he fell\u2014first onto an ice bulge about 20 feet\ndown and then farther down the ice until an ice screw he had placed held the fall.\nRescuers estimate he fell 60 feet in total, breaking a lower leg.\n    The belayer lowered the injured\nclimber down to his belay stance at\nthe fixed anchor on the top of the sec-\nond pitch. Climbers who were below\non the Black Dike and on the nearby\nFafnir rushed to assist the injured\nleader and dialed 911. New Hampshire\nFish and Game, in addition to volun-\nteer rescuers and a pair of guides who\nhad just finished working for the day,\nhiked up from the parking lot with a\nsled, bringing the total number of res-\ncuers to 14. The injured climber was\nattached to a volunteer with a rescue\nspider and lowered down the second\npitch. Rescuers then completed a\n120-meter lower down the first pitch\n                                          Rescuers working at the base of the Black Dike on\nand a snow slope at the base. They\n                                          Cannon Cliff, still about 1,000 vertical feet above\nplaced the patient in the litter and the trail. Bob Hall\nlowered and carried him down about\n1,000 vertical feet of snow and talus to the bike path below, about five hours after\nthe fall. A snowmobile then carried him to the road.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Black Dike, a climb that receives no sun, is often prone to brittle, \u201cdinner-plating\u201d\nice. Moreover, the heavy traffic this route receives creates a latticework of fractured\nice. Extra care must be taken when moving on ice tool and crampon placements.\n    Using more frequent, gentle swings\u2014instead of a few hard hits\u2014in brittle ice\nhelps to keep tool placements where they belong. Keeping picks, crampons, and ice\nscrews sharp and not climbing above bad placements helps keep winter climbing\nfrom spinning out of control. Ice screws work well as protection, but this doesn\u2019t\nstop the relatively low angle of most ice climbs from creating serious falling haz-\nard.

        "Incident_Type": "THREE FALLS ON ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled Out\nCathedral Ledge and Kancamagus Highway\nOn July 10, two climbers headed to the Barber Wall, a single-pitch crack climb-\ning area on the upper left side of Cathedral Ledge. The pair decided to get on\nNutcracker, a popular 5.10a. The leader (male, 30s) placed a number 2 Camalot,\nfollowed by two small cams below a little overlap or overhang. In order to protect\nthe upper part of the climb, he back-cleaned the number 2. As he attempted the\noverlap, he fell. Both of the remaining cams ripped out and the climber fell to the\nground, 30 feet below, hitting his belayer in the process.\n    A nearby climber responded to the accident and called for help. Shortly thereaf-\nter, the North Conway Fire Department and volunteers from the Mountain Rescue\nService arrived and carried the patient in a litter up to the parking lot and tourist\noverlook on top of Cathedral Ledge, roughly 200 feet above the Barber Wall. The\nclimber sustained minor fractures to vertebrae, a broken rib, and a lung contusion.\n    On October 2, an aid climber (male, 30s) was leading the first pitch of a potential\nnew route at the Painted Wall, a cliff off the Kancamagus Highway. Though it was\nnot this climber\u2019s first time up the pitch, on this occasion a piton ripped out as he\nweighted it, and the force of his fall pulled out two more pitons and an Alien cam.\nThe climber estimated he fell 15 to 18 feet before landing on the ground, seemingly\ninjuring his leg (subsequent X-rays revealed a hairline fracture on his pelvis).\n    The pair of climbers telephoned two friends who came to help, and the four of\nthem attempted to hike down the talus field at the base of the Painted Wall to the\nparking lot. When it became clear that self-evacuation was not an option due to\nthe patient\u2019s pain level, the climbers called Mountain Rescue Service, who pack-\naged the victim in a litter and carried him to the road.\n    On the weekend of October 14, two climbers hiked to Woodchuck Ledge, also\non the Kancamagus Highway, to attempt Screaming Yellow Zonkers, a 5.11c crack\nclimb. The leader (male, 20s) fell a couple of times onto small cams at the crux near\nthe top of the pitch. On his next fall, two small cams (number 1 and 2 Metolius Ul-\ntralight Master Cams) pulled out of the crack. The next piece down, an 0.3 Camalot,\nstopped his fall, but he still hit the ground with rope stretch, suffering a fractured\nwrist and a separated shoulder. New Hampshire Fish and Game responded, as well\nas another pair of climbers who were on the scene, and the injured climber was\ncarried out of the woods in a litter.\n\nANALYSIS\nThough separate incidents, these three falls have some things in common: Each\noccurred when relatively small gear placements failed, and each involved expe-\nrienced climbers. Even for knowledgeable trad climbers, protecting small cracks\nrequires more patience and practice, and sometimes simply requires more gear.\nBuilding equalized nests of small pieces and \u201coverprotecting\u201d the start of climbs is\noften what it takes to keep a leader from hitting the ground.\n    The Barber Wall has been the scene of four ground falls since 2014. Three of\nthese occurred because of gear placements failing. However, unlike the neighbor-\ning climb Double Vee, which has seen two ground falls in as many years, Nutcrack-\ner should be straightforward to protect.\n     It\u2019s notable that both the Nutcracker and Screaming Yellow Zonkers leaders\nbroke their helmets in their falls\u2014it\u2019s likely the helmets prevented other serious\ninjuries. Because of quick response by nearby climbers and rescue organizations,\nall three patients reached medical care with relative speed. Cell phones work in\nselect spots off the Kancamagus and at other backcountry New Hampshire crags.\nHowever, carrying an inReach or similar satellite communication device and a light\nfirst-aid kit is not a bad idea for the more remote cliffs of the Northeast.

        "Incident_Type": "NEW YORK\nFALL ON ICE",
        "Details_Factors": "Fatigue, Dehydration\nAdirondacks, Chapel Pond\nI took a 40-foot fall on ice at Chapel Pond,\nsmashed my face, and suffered a traumatic brain\ninjury, but lived to tell about it. It was February\n8, and I was guiding Rhiannon, a 200-foot WI4+\nline in the Power Play amphitheater, above Cha-\npel Pond. It was a warm day, and I was not feeling\nwell as we headed up to the base. I was moving so\nslowly while getting ready that my client asked\nme if I was okay. I told her I didn\u2019t feel great, but\nI figured I\u2019d be fine as soon as I started climbing.\n     A lot of people climb Rhiannon in two pitches,\nbut I usually do it in one with 70-meter half ropes.\nThe first part of the climb is a steep slab up to\na ledge, then a long vertical piece with a short,\nsteep headwall at the very top.\n     The ice was wet above the ledge, and I didn\u2019t\nwant my client to have to stop in the dripping ice\nto take out protection, so I placed my last screw\nat the ledge (that\u2019s normally how I climb the route\nanyway). About 20 feet above the ledge, I stopped\njust below the steepest part of the climb and\n                                                        A climber on the crux of Rhiannon,\ngot ready to place another screw. My tools were above the sloping ledge where Matt\nfirmly planted when it happened: My brain shut Horner impacted. Jim Lawyer\ndown\u2014I short-circuited and blacked out. I didn\u2019t\nblow out any ice, my tools didn\u2019t pop, my feet didn\u2019t pop. I literally just let go of my\ntools for a split second. I came to immediately and was very confused. I knew I was\nfalling, but I didn\u2019t know why. I had enough time to think, \u201cThis is not going to be good.\u201d\n     My client said that, watching from below, it looked like I was climbing normally\nand then she saw my body kind of slump, and then I was off.\n     I fell about 40 feet and smashed into the ice, face-first, and then slid another 10\n to 20 feet. I\u2019m sure there was some rope stretch, as there always is with half ropes.\nYou always fall a lot farther than you think you\u2019re going to. When I hit the ledge I\ngot knocked out, I don\u2019t know for how long, and then I woke up. My first thought\nwhen I came to was, \u201cOK, I\u2019m alive.\u201d My second thought was \u201cHoly, s***, there\u2019s a\nlot of blood.\u201d\n    My client lowered me to the base and untied me from the rope, and I got up and\nwalked out with her. At the hospital in Burlington, Vermont, the doctors said I had\na cerebral hemorrhage and I had broken every plate in my face; I broke my nose in\n10 places. I also had some minor soft-tissue injuries. Luckily, my face has healed,\nand I didn\u2019t need reconstructive surgery. My brain continues to heal.\n\nANALYSIS\nI\u2019m still not sure why I blacked out, but it was probably a combination of things.\nI was pushing really hard last season, climbing in the backcountry a lot and just\npushing, pushing, pushing. I may have been quite dehydrated as well, and I wasn\u2019t\neating well, especially for that kind of output. After my hospitalization, in a follow-\nup appointment, I had my Vitamin D level tested and it was very low. I don\u2019t know\nif that had anything to do with the accident, but I\u2019m on a supplement now. I\u2019ve also\nchanged my diet and lost weight. I\u2019m back to climbing hard routes and guiding.\n    If there\u2019s a lesson here, it\u2019s take care of yourself and pay attention to how you\nfeel. I always had a tendency to push through things and say, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And this\nday I knew I wasn\u2019t feeling well. This accident made me think about my health and\nalso got me into a renewed frame of mind. It\u2019s sort of like, \u201cWow, I got another shot,\nlet\u2019s try to be a little smarter about this.\u201d (Source: Matt Horner.)\n    Editor\u2019s note: Working guides often run it out to make seconding easier for their\nclients, but the consequences of a mistake or outside factors (rockfall, illness, etc.) can\nbe severe, not just for the guide but potentially the client as well.\n\nADIRONDACKS AND CATSKILLS SUMMARY: There were four technical climbing\nrescues in the mountains of upstate New York in 2017.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nShawangunks, The Trapps\nOn October 14, I started leading the direct start to Ventre de Boeuf, which be-\ngins with an easy squeeze chimney leading to a short 5.10 offwidth. Because of the\nchimney start, my first piece of pro was a number 4 Camalot maybe 20 feet off the\ndeck. I tried working the offwidth move for a bit, but ultimately found it to be a\nlittle too slimy and hard. The regular 5.9 start avoids this offwidth by climbing up\na thin crack maybe 12 feet to the right. Because I didn\u2019t want to yard on the cam to\nbypass the OW section (as it was my only pro), and not wanting to take a pendulum\nswing if I fell off the line to the right, I removed the cam, downclimbed a bit, and\n then started traversing up and to the right to\njoin the regular start.\n    I found only two marginal pieces of pro:\na small offset nut and then a sort of upward-\nfacing number 0.1 (red) Black Diamond X4 cam.\nThese pieces were about 1.5 feet apart from one\nanother.

The climber was about 40 feet up\nwhen a large hold pulled out, striking him in the foot. After his fall, the climber\ndownclimbed to the Grand Traverse Ledge (the start of the climb, accessed by\nrappel) and assessed the injury with his partner. Concluding the injury was minor,\nthe climber decided to make another attempt. After clearing the first roof in the\ncorner, he fell again\u2014this time an inverted fall of approximately 60 feet, during\nwhich the climber made contact with the cliff face, causing serious injury to the\nright hand.\n      The climber was stabilized and secured on Grand Traverse Ledge by his partner,\nwho then ascended to the high point and continued to the cliff top on a self-belay.\nDuring this process, while attempting to call rangers for assistance, the partner\ndropped his cell phone, but hikers passing by were able to contact the rangers.\nMeanwhile, the injured climber began slowly ascending the fixed line. Once on\nscene, rangers hauled the climber up the remaining distance, treated his injury,\nand transported the party back to their vehicles.\n    There was a reported incident of a climber in the Near Trapps who was climb-\ning alone and ran into trouble while self-lowering. [After finishing a route, instead\nof rappelling, the climber threaded his rope through a fixed anchor, tied back in, and\nthen used an ATC-style device on the other strand to lower himself from the anchor.]\nWhen still far above the ground, he noticed there was not enough rope to reach\nthe bottom of the climb and immediately stopped; it was reported the climber did\nnot have a stopper knot in the system and had less than a foot of rope remaining\nbelow his belay device. A local climber heard a call for help and found the climber\nhanging in space. The local soloed up above the stuck climber, set up an anchor,\nrappelled to the climber, and helped him to the ground.\n    Two climbers at the Trapps were stranded when they failed to untie a stop-\nper knot before attempting to pull their rappel rope down to an intermediate\nrappel station. The rope end became stuck above. The two climbers had no\nheadlamps or warm clothing, and were unable to ascend the rope to fix the\nproblem.

Climber 1 (male, age 28) was\nleading the third pitch of the route. After clipping the third bolt, a foothold broke,\ncausing him to fall approximately 15 feet, hit the belay ledge, knock off a large\nchunk of rock, and continue to fall an additional five feet before being caught by his\nbelayer. The climber sustained injuries to his left ankle that were later diagnosed as\na non-displaced fracture of the talus and calcaneus. Climber 2, the belayer (male,\nage 35), was clear of the path of the falling rock and escaped unharmed.\n   The climbers were using a 60-meter rope, which was of insufficient length for\nrappelling to the ground from their location. Climber 2 led the rest of the climb and\nassisted his injured partner up the remaining pitches to the top, from which they\ndescended by an established rappel route.\n\nANALYSIS\nDespite being friends for a number of years, the two had only climbed together on\nrare occasions. Prior to the day of the accident, they had climbed for two days at\nSmith Rock.

While on Lost in Space,\nClimber 2 sat on the belay ledge with his back to the Climber 1 and doled out slack\nat regular intervals without being cognizant of the amount of slack in the system\nand the climber\u2019s position on the wall. Climber 1 had just clipped the third bolt,\nabove his waist, when the foothold broke and initiated the fall. With appropriate\nslack in the system, he should have fallen only about five feet.\n    The takeaway here is to speak up if a climber is concerned about the belayer\u2019s\ntechnique, including maintaining positive control of the brake strand of the rope,\nmaintaining visual contact with the climber on the wall, and adjusting the slack in\nthe system to avoid ledge falls.

Pitch two looked moderate but had few options for protection.\nHaving climbed many pitches like this, I confidently set off. Twenty feet above the\nbelay ledge, I placed a cam and continued. Another 15 feet led to a tipped-out cam\nplacement behind a loose flake, then another 10 feet to a stance where I tried to\nput in another piece. As I was placing the gear, the rock under my foot broke and I\nfell. The cam below me blew out. Two small ledges slowed the speed of my long fall,\nwhich landed me next to my partner, tangled in rope and upside down.\n    After going in and out of consciousness for the next five minutes, I came to. Chloe\nwas able to assist in untangling me from the rope. She assessed me for injuries and\nhead trauma. My helmet was intact but dented from the fall.

Even without passing up\nany opportunities for protection, there was much less gear than I was comfortable\nwith. We studied a possible variation that was less direct, but it did not look like\nit would offer any more protection than the line we chose. I should have looked\nharder for alternatives or perhaps retreated.\n    I am thankful my partner was a nurse; otherwise, my outcome could have been\nvery different.

None of his compan-\nions wanted to follow the climb, and since it traverses to the right, the climber decided\nit would be easiest to descend and then reclimb the pitch on top-rope to clean it.\nHowever, the diagonal climb would have made rappelling difficult, and he was reluc-\ntant to simply lower because he worried the rough rock would abrade his rope.\n    Instead, he asked one of his friends to tie into the belayer\u2019s end of the rope\n(the strand running through the protection on the route) to weight it. Using this\ncounter-balance, the climber planned to rappel the other strand of rope to the\nground. However, the climber on the ground was relatively inexperienced and did\nnot clearly understand the technique he\u2019d been asked to perform.

Toward the top, I was\npumped and decided to run it out, hoping to get\nto a good rest and place a piece. It was getting\ndark (approximately 9:15 p.m.), so I wanted to\nhurry. My foot slipped, right at the end of the\ncrux, and I took a good 25-foot whipper, ending\nup facing away from the rock and flipping over\nat the last minute.\n    After the fall, I was feeling really tired and I\ndidn\u2019t think I could finish the route that day. I\n                                                       This vintage cam, found in a Zion crack,\ndidn\u2019t have enough gear to aid to the anchors,\n                                                       failed as a makeshift rappel anchor\neither. Right at the base of the crux was a fixed despite testing. Benton Mitchell\ncam, so I went back up the route to my last piece,\njust above the fixed cam. I clipped my belay loop to the fixed piece and bounce-\ntested it repeatedly while still clipped into the backup piece above it. I double-checked\nthat the cam was truly fixed in the crack, and everything looked good.\n    Still clipped to my backup cam, I ran the rope through the old fixed cam, tested\nit once more, and then removed the backup and shifted all my weight to begin the\nrappel. About a foot into the rappel the cam popped out. The next thing I knew\nI was lying on the ground on top of the coiled rope, with rope burns all over. My\npartner had rope burns on his hands as well. He had been giving me a fireman\u2019s\nbelay and tried to catch the rope as I fell.\n    My hip took most of the blow from the fall, along with my elbow and my heels.\nMiraculously I was okay, aside from severe bruising, whiplash, and rope burn. My\npartner ran down to ask the last park shuttle to wait for me. My head was spinning\n as I packed up my gear, but I did not seem to have a head injury, which was very\nfortunate. I did not have a helmet and somehow landed in the only flat spot\u2014sharp\nrocks surrounded the area. We determined the fall was roughly 40 feet.\n\nANALYSIS\nI trusted a single piece of fixed gear in desert sandstone. I didn\u2019t know how long it\nhad been there, who had already worked on getting it out, or how strong it was. I\nbelieve that when my weight shifted from a somewhat outward pull to a straight\ndownward pull the cam slipped. I understand that the sport we play is a risky one,\nbut was it worth trying to save a little bit of money by not leaving a backup cam?\nGear can be replaced, but life cannot. My partner also realized that he should have\nspoken up and asked me to leave my own gear.\n    I now have a whole new appreciation for making sure that gear is solid. And for\nwearing a helmet!

        "Details_Factors": "Miscommunication\nLower West Bolton\nAt approximately 6 p.m. on September 16, I responded to the report of a fatal rock\nclimbing accident at the Lower West Bolton climbing area. I was directed to an\nambulance where the two subjects who had been climbing with the deceased\n(20-year-old Rebecca Ryan, \u201cRR\u201d) were waiting. I briefly interviewed LK (19) to get\nher version of the events before I went to the scene of the accident. The other\npartner (IH, 21) was present but said very little.\n    LK indicated that RR was top-roping a route (later determined to be Harvest\nMoon, 5.7+) while belayed from the bottom of the climb. The climb is approximately\n80 feet high, and the top is not visible from the bottom. LK said that RR completed\nthe climb and gave the command \u201coff belay\u201d to indicate that she had secured her-\nself to the anchor at the top. LK was under the impression that RR was going to\nrappel down the route, and she removed her harness to await RR\u2019s descent. LK then\nheard RR yell down, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d She then realized that RR may have been ex-\npecting her to lower her down the route, and she yelled up that she was not ready\nand scrambled to put her harness back on. (IH later remembered the events in a\nvery similar way.) Before she could don her harness, LK observed RR free-fall down\nthe cliff, landing at the bottom.\n    I asked if they had discussed before the climb what method RR was going to\nuse to descend, but she was not clear on that point. I then examined the scene and\nfound the following:\n     \u2022 RR was tied into one end of the rope in a configuration (Figure 8 follow-through\n        knot properly tied through her harness) that would be consistent with climbing\n        the route and being lowered back down to the bottom by her partner. If she was\n        planning on rappelling, the rope would not have been tied in to her harness.\n      \u2022 RR did not have a rappel device on her harness, which would indicate that she\n       did not have an easy way of rappelling down the route. Her options would have\n       been to be lowered by LK or walk off the route around the top of the cliff.\n     \u2022 RR was not wearing a helmet. It was lying on the ground near her pack at the\n       base of the climb.\n     \u2022 At the top of the climb the rope was threaded through the two bolted anchors,\n       consistent with RR\u2019s expectation that she would be lowered from the top.\n    Five days after the accident, a state police detective and I met with LK and IH\nto review the sequence of events that led up to the accident. We learned that RR\nwas the most experienced of the climbers, and LK and IH had looked to her as the\n\u201cleader\u201d of the group, though her outdoor experience was limited. LK said she had\njust bought her first rope, and this was her first outing using it.\n    The pattern of climbing throughout the day, prior to the accident, had been for\nthe belayer to lower the climber. At no point during the day had anybody rappelled.\nNevertheless, both LK and IH remember RR indicating that her intent was to rap-\npel down their final route (where the accident occurred) after cleaning the anchor.\n(Source: Neil Van Dyke, Department of Public Safety.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis incident strongly reinforces the importance of a climber and belayer clearly\ncommunicating a plan for descending from each anchor, especially when the an-\nchor is out of sight (and possibly out of clear hearing range) from the ground.\n    In some cases, a climber may need to change the descent plan en route. In this\ncase, RR had stated that she planned to rappel but had no device on her harness\nor the rope when she fell, suggesting she may have forgotten to carry it and thus\nwas forced to change plans once she reached the anchor. Whenever there is such a\nchange of plans, the climber should communicate the new plan as clearly and loudly\nas possible and wait for acknowledgment from the belayer. Then, the climber should\ntest the lowering system before unclipping from the anchor, making sure the belayer\nis holding his or her weight. (Source: The Editors.)",

        "Details_Factors": "No Backup\nNorth Cascades National Park, Torment-Forbidden Traverse\nOn the morning of July 21, Susan Bennett, 61, and three partners set out to climb\nthe Torment-Forbidden traverse. They completed the south ridge of Torment, and\nafter a bivy on the ridge between Torment and Forbidden they got a late start the\nnext morning due to overnight rain soaking their gear. They were moving toward\nForbidden before noon.\n   At the notch below the west ridge of Forbidden, the climbers left some of their\ngear, planning to return this way from the summit before descending into Boston\nBasin. The climbers broke into two teams, and Bennett\u2019s team reached the false\n                                        summit just as the other team was descending\n                                       from the true summit. After Bennett and her\n                                       partner hit the summit, they downclimbed the\n                                       west ridge until the top of a 5.6 pitch. Because\n                                       they were wearing mountaineering boots,\n                                       they decided to rappel this section instead of\n                                       downclimb. They set up a rappel from an exist-\n                                       ing anchor, using their doubled 8mm to 8.2mm\n                                       rope. After throwing down the ends, Bennett\u2019s\n                                       partner noted that they had not tied stop-\n                                       per knots and wondered aloud if they should\n                                       fix this error, but Bennett expressed fear that\n                                       knots might get caught in the rocks. She had\n                                       an autoblock cord clipped to her harness, but\nForbidden Peak from the northwest. The\n                                       apparently did not use it for this rappel.\nX marks approximate location of rappel\naccident. Ron Clausen | Wikipedia          At approximately 4:30 p.m., Bennett started\n                                       to rappel at a 45\u00b0 angle from the anchor, ap-\nparently attempting to stay on the ridgeline. At a stance about 25 meters down,\nshe lost her footing and began to pendulum. Her partner could not see what hap-\npened, but later said he thought Bennett had impacted with the rock slab and was\nknocked unconscious. After she re-entered his view, the partner saw Bennett start\nto slide slowly down the rope, and he yelled for her to grab her brake line. She\ndidn\u2019t respond and slid off the end of the rope. She struck a ledge and then began\na long tumble over the north face of the mountain. Her helmet broke into several\npieces and she disappeared into the clouds near the glacier.\n    In poor visibility, the other two climbers heard Bennett\u2019s partner yelling that\nshe\u2019d fallen. They said they would come up to assist him after calling for help. At\nthe notch, they located an inReach device in Bennett\u2019s pack and activated it. Once\nthey were all together, the group debated trying to descend to the north to look\nfor Bennett, but felt they did not have the equipment nor time to make an effective\nsearch (it was now 5:30 p.m.), and they knew a search and rescue effort already had\nbeen initiated. Instead, they descended together toward Boston Basin, carrying\nBennett\u2019s gear, until they met a National Park Service helicopter. Bennett\u2019s body\nwas spotted about 30 feet down in a crevasse on the Forbidden Glacier around\n7,100 feet. (Source: North Cascades National Park incident reports.)\n\nANALYSIS\nBennett was an experienced climber and past instructor with the Mountaineers. It\nis not clear why she skipped safety precautions (third-hand backup, stopper knots)\nthat she usually used, including during a previous rappel on this same trip. To ad-\ndress concerns about stopper knots getting stuck, they could have carried the rappel\nrope in coils with them (using \u201csaddlebags\u201d or a similar technique) as they descended\nand then untied the stopper knots once they were off rappel. Although the official\nreports do not suggest this, it\u2019s possible that Bennett was feeling rushed by their late\nstart, the deteriorating weather, and the fact that their climbing companions were\nmoving faster, and thus took unusual shortcuts with the rappel.

        "Details_Factors": "ICE COLLAPSE\nNorth Cascades National Park, Ptarmigan Traverse\nOn July 30, my climbing partner, Stefan Goldberg (62) and I (67, both highly experi-\nenced mountaineers) began the Ptarmigan Traverse, climbing north to south. Our\nplan was to spend 12 days on the route, go as far as time permitted, and double\nback to the trailhead after climbing satellite peaks along the route. However, wild-\nfire smoke conspired against us, making navigation and climbing more hazardous,\nso after five days we decided to retreat toward Kool Aid Lake.\n    On August 3, we traversed a rock feature called the Red Ledges. When we had\ncrossed this on the way in, a snow ramp had contacted the rock directly and the\ntransition was straightforward. We now found a far different scenario, with a melt-\ned-out ramp that created a gap of about eight to ten feet and necessitated a rappel\nof 15 to 20 feet. Temperatures in nearby Marblemount had exceeded 100\u00b0F the last\nseveral days, which greatly\ncontributed to the rapid melt-\nout. A moat barrier now pre-\nsented itself, and what had\nonce been a snow ramp was\nnow an icy serac or fin with an\nadjoining snow cornice.\n    Thankfully, a climbing\nparty of four who had started\nthe traverse a day ahead of us\nhad left a sling with two cara-\nbiners over a rock horn for a\nrappel. Stefan went first, rap-\npelling about 20 feet into the\nmoat. He placed an ice screw\ninto hard, nearly vertical snow\nand attached a sling and ex-\ntra carabiner to this to assist\n                                   The icy fin in center collapsed and knocked the photographer\nmy transition from rock to into a moat just as he rappelled from the Red Ledges above.\nsnow. He then surmounted Fortunately, he had only minor injuries. Stefan Goldberg\nthe snow wall with two front-\npoint kicks, using one ice axe, and started to traverse out of the moat. He was about\neight feet left of the ice serac, moving away from it, when, to my horror, I observed\na crack open up at the juncture of the serac and snow wall and run directly toward\nStefan. As the crack reached him, another crack opened up, perpendicular to the\nfirst. Stefan fell straight down into the moat among tumbling snow and ice blocks. It\nwas like watching a horror video in slow motion.\n     The ice serac tumbled over sideways until it was stopped by contact with the\nadjacent rock and vertical snow ledge. I feared the serac would break apart and\nbury Stefan deep in the moat or make contact with the rope, rip out the anchor\nsling, and pull me down. I could see some daylight in the depths of the moat, and\nafter several seconds of silence Stefan yelled out, \u201cI\u2019m OK.\u201d Miraculously, he had\nsuffered only superficial wounds to his arm and minor head and neck discomfort.\nHe climbed the sloping moat with his 60-pound pack, advancing his prusik up the\nrappel rope as self-protection, then transitioned onto the edge of the newly in-\nverted serac. He placed an ice screw and transitioned back onto solid snow, where\nhe placed a snow picket. I then rappelled to the serac edge, surmounted it, and re-\nmoved the screw and picket. We traversed the snowfield to an adjacent talus field,\nwhere we thanked our creator that we were still alive.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe extreme heat undoubtedly played a major role in the instability of the icy serac\nand snow ramp. Visual inspection revealed no obvious problems, except for the\nsnowy cornice, which Stefan climbed past with no problems. There might have\nbeen a better way to get through the moat, but the serac could have fallen which-\never way we went. Simply put, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time. On\nthe positive side, we made several good decisions by relying on a good, strong anchor,\nusing a backup prusik on the rappel, and wearing helmets.

The group de-\ncided to descend there rather than finish the easier last three pitches.\n    In order to save time, Withington and his crew opted to simul-rappel in pairs\nrather than do individual rappels. Withington and his partner went first. The two\nwere not in sync, and Withington\u2019s partner reached the belay ledge at the top of the\nsixth pitch first and then apparently let go of his strand of the rope (as one would\ntypically do upon reaching a ledge in a normal, solo rappel). The climbers had not\ntied stopper knots in the ends of the rope, so the rope slipped through the partner\u2019s\ndevice, allowing Withington to fall. One of the climbers at the upper anchor attempt-\ned to grab the rope as it pulled through the anchor and was seriously burned but\nunable to stop the rope. Withington fell about 300 feet before he struck a ledge, then\nfell another 200 feet or so to the base of the climb. Another team preparing to climb\nSisyphus witnessed the accident and called 911. A rescue team helped Withington\u2019s\npartners descend. (Sources: Okanogan Search and Rescue and published accounts.)\n\n\n94 / ACCIDENTS 2018\n ANALYSIS\nSimul-rappelling relies on counterbalance, with each side of the rope weighted\nsimultaneously and continuously. Withington and his partner could have ensured\nthey were descending at the same speed and arrived at the ledge at the same time,\nso they could unweight the system together. A stopper knot and/or friction-hitch\nbackup on the partner\u2019s rope might have prevented the rope from slipping through\nhis device.\n    Simul-rappelling has been the cause of several fatalities in recent years. Al-\nthough it is theoretically faster than rappelling one at a time, the extra care that\nmust be taken to ensure a safe simul-rappel erases much of that benefit. It is not a\nrecommended technique.

The team shoveled out a flat platform in the snow, stabilized my\ninjuries, and kept me warm in my sleeping bag. About 90 minutes after the ac-\ncident, I was airlifted off the mountain. My injuries included a severely sprained\nright ankle, compression fractures in my L4 and L5 lumbar vertebrae, and a deep\nlaceration on my left forearm.\n\nANALYSIS\nSeveral things contributed to the accident. I was inexperienced in descending\nsteep, snow-covered slopes. We didn\u2019t scout the descent route in advance, and by\nthe time we all saw the crevasse and how serious it was, we were already on the\nslope. It\u2019s possible that if we had known about the existence of the crevasse, we\nmight have chosen a different descent route.\n   We descended late in the day when the snow was slushy. This made for very\nunstable footing and insecure axe placements. I also used incorrect self-arrest\n technique; only later did I learn that I had learned and practiced a faulty method.\nMy heavy backpack had weighed me down and contributed to my fall, but it ul-\ntimately may have saved my life by absorbing some impact when I landed on my\nback.

        "Details_Factors": "Fatigue, Poor Snow Conditions\nMt. Adams, North Cleaver\nOn July 7, my climbing partner (Hayley Dukatz, 31) and I set off from high camp for\na run at the Adams Glacier on the north side of Mt. Adams. We had both climbed\nthe mountain several times via other technical and nontechnical routes. A strong,\nwarm wind blew throughout the night, so while the sky was clear, the snow did not\nfirm up at all.\n    After an uneventful ascent, we began our descent from the summit by the\nNorth Cleaver Route: a nontechnical, scree-covered ridge that runs adjacent to the\nAdams Glacier. Around 9,000 feet, we encountered a brief snow traverse. My part-\nner slipped on the soft, slick snow, and I promptly fell too. Tired and now angry, I\nstepped onto the exposed ridge, following in Hayley\u2019s path. One of her footsteps\ncollapsed and I started to slide. I immediately went into self-arrest, and my axe\nstuck briefly before the pick popped out and I was off to the races.\n    The slope was steep and fairly uniform but for one little opening about halfway\ndown, which I may have hit with the tip of my ice axe. My partner said I caught air.\nAbout 300 feet below, I landed in a crevasse/moat and was knocked unconscious.\n    I came to quickly and immediately donned layers. I saw blood in my saliva and\nfelt intense pain in my right posterior ribs, and so I decided to activate my satellite\nmessenger\u2019s SOS.\n    I crawled out of the moat and began to laboriously descend the Lava Glacier,\ncontouring the ridgeline we\u2019d been following. I wasn\u2019t able to take in full breaths\nof air, and each step compounded the effort. Eventually, I was able to put my pack\nback on and negotiate some mid-5th-class terrain to regain the ridge, at which\npoint my partner and I met up.\n     We evaluated my injuries and decided to ask for a rescue, given that camp was\nstill 2,000 feet below us, with a five-mile hike out after that, the sun was setting,\nand we had little remaining food. A helicopter airlifted my partner and me off the\nmountain. The hospital confirmed a comminuted mandibular fracture (jaw frac-\nture) and I received surgery 10 days later.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe snow conditions were less than ideal, but that we knew from the first step.\nWe post-holed up many sections of the Adams Glacier and the icefall. As the day\nwarmed and the sun shone, the snow turned from soft to slushy. These conditions\nwere not the cause of the accident, but they introduced time pressure by greatly\nincreasing our climbing time.\n   As we descended, my fatigue was on full display as I slipped and fell several\ntimes on the abundant scree. By the time we\u2019d encountered the fateful traverse,\nthe snow quality was very soft and slick. Falling into the snow just before the ex-\nposed section caused me to lose what little remained of my focus, and thus I failed\nto evaluate my footing before committing my full weight. I was lucky to sustain\nonly the injuries that I did, and to have external assistance available to me.\n   Finally, I believe that pressure in the mountains exacerbates personality traits\u2014\nhaving an accident like this is not necessarily one and done. The core issue of\ncharging ahead feverishly when irritation takes root rather than staying cautious,\nalert, and careful must be addressed. (Source: Alexander Vasarab, 28.)",

He was approxi-\nmately 40 feet up the route and took a short fall onto his fourth protection piece,\na number 0.3 Camalot, which pulled out. The resulting tug on the rope appar-\nently levered out his third protection piece, a number 2 Wild Country nut, before\nhe weighted it, and the next pieces down were too low to keep him from hitting\nthe ground. The climber\u2019s legs impacted a less than vertical area on the lower part\nof the climb, upending him, and his head struck a rock on the ground.

        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience\nNew River Gorge, Bubba City, Tattoo Wall\nOn the morning of October 28, with rain forecasted to begin by midday, my girl-\nfriend, Liza Mindemann (age 33), and I (age 39) decided to get an early start on\nthe third day of a two-week climbing road trip. We\u2019d been together not even two\nmonths, and climbing is very much part of our relationship. In fact, we met at the\nGunks, and since then I\u2019d been teaching her to lead trad. She\u2019d led up to 5.7 at the\nGunks and followed a few 5.10s.\n    Walking down the approach trail to Tattoo Wall, I suggested she jump on Mrs.\nField\u2019s Follies (5.8 sport) first thing. The day before, she had led Geisha Girl (5.8),\nher first ever sport lead, with no problems. She also had tried the adjacent Mrs.\nField\u2019s, one of the longest moderates at the New. However, it was the end of the\nday, she was spent, and she couldn\u2019t get past the roof at the eighth bolt.\n    When we arrived, I announced (all too eagerly) that \u201cwe had an appointment\nwith Mrs. Fields.\u201d With no actual discussion but only a kind of acquiescence to my\nmore dominant energy\u2014plus a certain rationality in both of us warming up on the\n5.8\u2014it was decided that Liza would try Mrs. Field\u2019s Follies right away. In retrospect,\nI believe this was the single most important factor in the subsequent accident.\n    Liza led past the first few bolts with no outward issues, but at the first crux, on\na slabby section with potential for smacking the ledge below, she grabbed a bolt\nwith her finger and screamed in frustration, \u201cI just cheated!\u201d She continued up\nthe relatively easier sections above, still exhibiting nervousness and not breathing\nsmoothly, until she reached the eighth bolt, where she had lowered off the day be-\nfore. She stepped up to the roof to clip, backed down, and on the second attempt\nshe pulled the roof successfully. She was psyched. However, she was unable to find\na good position to clip the next bolt above the roof. She soon peeled off and im-\npacted a ledge below. With pain in her right foot, she lowered to the base.\n    Once on the ground, it was clear Liza could not stand on her right foot and it\n was most likely broken. After cleaning the route with Liza belaying in relative calm\n(amazingly), I set her up with a phone and jacket to sit on and ran to the car to ditch\nthe pack and grab some duct tape. We rigged a splint and I piggybacked her most\nof the way back to the car. At the local urgent-care facility, the physician\u2019s assistant\ndiagnosed her with a possible comminuted fracture to the calcaneus and talus, later\nconfirmed by CT scans at the local hospital. Fortunately, surgery was not required.\n(Source: Sam Janis.)\n\nANALYSIS\nOn easier climbs at the New River Gorge (and elsewhere), ledge falls are often a\nhazard for the leader. Mrs. Field\u2019s Follies is 100 feet tall, and given the amount of\nrope out at that point, rope stretch was a likely contributor to the ledge fall.\n   The climber probably best identified the causes of the accident when she\nstated, \u201cBeing relatively new to the sport, I find one of my biggest frustrations\ncomes from the inconsistency in my climbing, knowing I can do something\nbut...letting the mental game overthrow my ability to remain present in the\nclimb. Thinking I was only a few moves away from the top, I started up some-\nwhat carelessly, looking for favorable hands, not finding them, but moving up\nanyways, thinking better handholds would be revealed and essentially forget-\nting my feet.\u201d Many new climbers face similar challenges.

His partners and he would all be\n considered to have the requisite skill and experience to ski the Amora Vida Couloir.\n    The victim\u2019s partners described the skiing conditions prior to the accident as\npretty good. They practiced safe technique, skiing one at a time between safe areas.\nAt one point, the question of whether they were on the right route came up; how-\never, the subject, who had the most route information, made the decision to start\ndown the couloir where the accident occurred. He also decided to keep his skis on\nhis feet while navigating a short narrow section that required his tips and tails to\nbe touching the rock. Unfortunately, the heel piece of his Dynafit bindings released.\n(The skis were not recovered, so the binding description came from his partners).\nSince his toe piece did not release, it is presumed that he had it in the upright, or\nlocked, position. It is not uncommon for ski mountaineers to descend steep, com-\nmitting terrain with the toe piece locked to prevent inadvertent release.\n     Witness statements indicate that the subject did not appear tense or scared\neven after the heel piece released, and he worked to position himself to click back\ninto his binding. When he started to slide, he attempted to self-arrest using his\nWhippet (ski-pole self-arrest grip). However, the snow was too soft for the Whip-\npet to gain any purchase. Unfortunately, in this type of high-consequence terrain,\nthere is very little margin for error or equipment failure. (Source: National Park\nService Search and Rescue Report.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Route-Finding Errors, Inadequate Clothing\nGrand Teton National Park, Grand Traverse\nOn the afternoon of August 11, a 30-year-old male, Climber 1, and 23-year-old fe-\nmale, Climber 2, began an attempt on the Grand Traverse, a complex and challeng-\ning route linking ten Teton summits. Climber 1 had been climbing for about eight\nyears, primarily bouldering and sport climbing, with minimal traditional and alpine\nclimbing experience. In the Tetons, he had done the complete Exum Ridge on the\nGrand Teton. Climber 2 had been climbing for 10 years, with a strong sport climb-\ning resum\u00e9 but limited traditional climbing experience and no alpine experience.\nThis was her first visit to the Tetons.\n    For this climb they brought standard rock climbing equipment, climbing shoes,\nand a 70-meter rope. Overnight gear included a tent, two lightweight sleeping bags,\nand food for four days and three nights. Personal gear included warm insulating layers\nand trail running shoes. Neither of them brought a rain jacket or rain pants.\n    In three days they climbed over Teewinot and Mt. Owen and made it to the\nGrandstand at the base of the north ridge of the Grand. They were moving much\nslower than expected due to the complexity of route-finding and the constant ex-\nposed climbing in unfamiliar terrain. They realized that they could not complete\nthe Grand Traverse but were hoping to finish their trip on the fourth day by climb-\ning the north ridge of the Grand Teton, descending the Owen-Spalding Route, and\nthen walking down from the Lower Saddle.\n    It rained overnight, and they woke to light rain and poor visibility. They decided\nto attempt the north ridge (the crux of the Grand Traverse, 5.8 and approximate-\nly 10 pitches) despite the poor weather, because, in their minds, it was the only\nway off the mountain. Route-finding was difficult due to limited visibility, and the\nclimbing was increasingly difficult amid rain and snow showers. They were losing\ndexterity in their fingers and toes, and at one point, Climber 1 took an estimated\n40-foot fall but was able to complete the pitch. Higher on the route, snowfall began\nincreasing. On August 14, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Climber 1 called the Teton\ndispatch center and was transferred to SAR coordinator Gordon Fletcher.\n     Fletcher had a brief discussion with the distressed party, attempting to deter-\nmine their location in relation to the Second Ledge, which is an exit to the Upper\nSaddle. They were unaware if they had passed or had yet to arrive at Second Ledge.\nRanger Fletcher explained that, due to current weather conditions, it was unlikely\nthat rescue personnel could get to them that night and they would need to find a\nway to stay as comfortable as they could until morning.\n    Rangers at the Lower Saddle reported light snow and strong winds, with ac-\ncumulating snow at the Upper Saddle. At 6:20 p.m., rangers Phil Edmonds and Vic\nZeilman began to ascend toward the Upper Saddle with climbing and rescue gear,\nwith the idea of crossing the Second Ledge to see if they could make contact with\nthe distressed climbers. However, the climbing conditions were too hazardous and\nthey returned to the Lower Saddle. The climbers reported they were able to rappel\nto a ledge and get in a tent, and they spent the night there.\n    On the morning of August 15, the climbers were still wet and cold, but the clouds\nhad lifted, the sun was coming out, and they could see the Grandstand an esti-\nmated 300 feet below them. Two rappels brought them back to the Grandstand,\n                                                          at 12,600 feet, where they called\n                                                         ranger Fletcher again to report\n                                                         their location.

        "Details_Factors": "Uneven Ropes\nGrand Teton National Park, Cathedral Traverse, Peak 11,840\u2019\nOn August 25, at 10:15 a.m., Grand Teton SAR coordinator Drew Hardesty was con-\ntacted by Exum guide Joe Stern, who reported that he had found a deceased solo\nclimber at the base of the rappels on the southwest side of Peak 11,840\u2019, a summit\nbetween Teewinot and Mt. Owen, often traversed as part of the Cathedral Traverse\nor Grand Traverse. At 12:15 p.m., rangers were flown to Peak 11,840\u2019, rappelled to\nthe deceased climber, and arranged to have his body flown off the mountain. The\nclimber was later identified as Alexander Kenan (24) from North Carolina.\n    From photos and social media posts by the deceased, it was determined that he\nhad fallen on the morning of August 22, likely between 7:30 and 9 a.m. In their in-\nvestigation, rangers determined he had fallen approximately 65 feet from the final\nrappel on the southwest face of Peak 11,840\u2019, after rappelling off the end of his rope.\nA locking carabiner was found attached to the belay loop on the climber\u2019s harness\nand clipped to a tube-style rappel device, with the screw gate locked. A 60-meter\nrope (estimated to be 8mm to 9mm in diameter, with a faded middle mark) was\nproperly loaded in the rappel device\u2019s right slot. The left slot was empty. Both the\ncarabiner and rappel device were structurally intact, the rope showed no signs of\ndamage or wear, and a prusik was on the subject\u2019s harness but not rigged to be\nused as a backup.\n    One end of the rope had a barrel knot tied in it approximately seven inches from\nthe end, while the other end of the rope was unknotted. The knotted end of the\nrope came out of the brake-hand side of the rappel device and extended 46 feet\nbelow. This information (combined with burns on the decedent\u2019s left hand, which\nwas likely his upper stabilization hand during the rappel) suggests that the ends of\nthe rope were uneven during the rappel and that he rappelled off one end of the\nrope. (Source: National Park Service Search and Rescue Report.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis particular rappel transitions from blockier terrain to a final bulge that would\nhave made the ends of the rope difficult to see from above. The climber likely\nwould not have been able to observe the disparity in rope lengths until very shortly\nbefore his fall.\n    One of two scenarios likely occurred. One, the\nvictim tied stopper knots in both ends of the rope,\nbut one knot perhaps came undone during the\nrappel. The other scenario is that, while stationed\nat his last rappel anchor, he fed rope through the\nanchor, tied a stopper knot in that end of the rope,\nand fed it down the cliff as he pulled the rope from\nthe previous rappel. In this scenario, he did not put\na knot in the end that fell from above and did not\npull the rope ends up to ensure they were even.\nEither way, when he reached the unknotted end,\napproximately 75 feet below the anchor, the rope\nend would have pulled through his device and he\nwould have fallen about 25 feet and then tumbled Three 100-foot rappels descend\nanother 40 feet down ledge-filled terrain.

If the\nrope is not marked (or if there is any chance the rope has been cut so the middle\nmark is incorrect), lower the two ends together to ensure they remain even. Either\nway, place stopper knots in both ends and use a friction-hitch backup. (Source:\nNational Park Service Search and Rescue Report and the Editors.)\n\n",

We had climbed Rock On and planned to continue up\nthe Squamish Buttress (mostly 5.6 with one 5.10c pitch; about six more pitches).\nAt the top of Rock On, we met two climbers (Franz and Mitch, both in their early\n20s), who had just finished Calculus Crack (5.8). They too intended to finish via the\nSquamish Buttress. We played rock-paper-scissors to see who went first, and they\nwon the game and started climbing.\n    While I was leading the second-to-last and crux pitch, I heard what I thought\nwas a substantial rockfall, then saw a body pendulum toward me, skipping and\nspinning off the wall, upside down. The climber stopped falling about 30 feet to my\nleft, unconscious, very bloody, and still upside down. It was Mitch. He appeared to\nbe dead for about one minute. I called down to Scott, my partner, to make sure he\nwas okay, then quickly plugged in an anchor. Scott yelled up to take it slow and not\nto jeopardize our safety. It was a good reminder. During this communication, Mitch\n came back to consciousness with one enormous,\ngasping breath. He was reasonably alert and able\nto follow commands, but severely concussed.\nFor the next hour, he would ask questions about\nwhere the blood came from and where he was.\n    The sheath of their rope was ripped clean for\nabout 40 feet, and the rope showed core damage.\nWe quickly formulated a plan for me to swing over\nto Mitch, clip him into me, and then Scott would\nlower both of us about 30 feet to his belay ledge\nfrom the temporary anchor I had built. Mitch\u2019s\nbelayer, Franz, yelled down that he was still belay-\ning Mitch with a Grigri and that he would be able\nto lower him as well.\n    Once down, we immobilized Mitch at the base\nof the crux pitch on a huge ledge. There was a lot\nof blood, but this was most likely from his nose;\nthere were no open wounds on his head. We called\nfor a rescue, and Mitch was airlifted off the Chief\nwithin two hours of the accident. We finished the\nclimb as a team of three and walked down with\nFranz. Mitch survived with a serious concussion.\n\nANALYSIS\nMitch was leading the last pitch (5.6) when he fell.\nHe had placed two small C3 cams right next to\n                                                       Helicopter rescue from Squamish\neach other in a poor flaring seam, and both cams Buttress. Peter Morgan\npulled out. He fell about 50 vertical feet and also\npendulumed about 50 feet. Franz was flipped upside down, and I think he might\nhave lost control of the belay if he had been using a tube-style device instead of a\nGrigri. I don\u2019t think Mitch would have survived if he had not been wearing a helmet.\nBoth climbers were new to traditional, multi-pitch routes, and my partner and I\nobserved that neither seemed to have solid technical skills.\n   On a separate note, it\u2019s a good idea to leave your car keys hidden near your\ncar. Franz\u2019s shoes (and car keys) were in the backpack that fell off Mitch while he\nwas upside down, and after descending the Chief in bare feet, he was somewhat\nstranded. (Source: Peter Morgan.)",

After successfully completing the climb, the lead-\ner was being lowered. When she was about four meters above the ground, the be-\nlayer\u2019s end of the rope went through her device and the leader fell to the ground.

However, guidebook descriptions\nshould not be trusted blindly, and ropes often shrink with age and use. Although\nlowering from this route is possible with a 70-meter rope, care must be taken with\nthe location of the belayer and the climber\u2019s landing.

(Whether the climber was leading or top-roping\nwas not clear from reports.) The belayer was pulled forward, slamming into rock and\nseriously injuring her knee. Rescuers hauled her to the top of the cliff in a litter and\ntransported her to the hospital. (Source: Times Colonist newspaper, Victoria, BC.)\n\nANALYSIS\nClimbers should be mindful of several issues when belaying heavier leaders from\nthe ground. If the climber weighs substantially more than the belayer (50 percent\nor greater weight difference is a good guideline), the belayer should be appropri-\nately anchored; however, be aware of rockfall danger to the belayer and the ability\nto communicate effectively with the climber. The belayer should be positioned as\ndirectly under the leader as the terrain and overhead hazards allow. Avoid belaying\nfrom perches on boulders, talus, or hillsides where the sudden force of a fall may\ncause the belayer to swing or be dragged across the ground. (Source: The Editors.)\n\n\nAVALANCHE\nBritish Columbia, Northern Selkirks\nOur party of six attempted an abbreviated version of the North Selkirks ski tra-\nverse, starting on April 16. On Friday, April 21, we left the Great Cairn (Ben Ferris)\nhut for the Guardsman Glacier and the summit of the Footstool, adjacent to Mt. Sir\nSandford. We summited the Footstool on skis around noon, then waited out some\ncloudy weather for about an hour. From the col east of the summit of Footstool, we\ndescended to the north from approximately 3,100 meters to roughly 2,850 meters\non the Guardsman Glacier. At about 1:45 p.m. we decided to do another run adja-\ncent to our ski tracks.\n    At approximately 2 p.m., while we were ascending our up-track, a natural, size\n3 slab avalanche originating at about 3,000 meters on a northeast aspect caught\nthree of the six members of our group.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe following factors were supportive\n                                              Mt. Sir Sandford and the Footstool, showing\nof our decision to ski up and down this approximate avalanche extent. John Scurlock\nslope and then head up for another run.\nThere was supportive snowpack, no avalanche activity had been observed that day\nor the preceding five days, and temperatures were stable. There was no deteriora-\ntion to snow or ski quality consistent with rapid warming. The slope chosen to ski\nwas very conservative: an angle of 20\u00b0 or less. The slope that released was adjacent\nto our ski run and was quite steep (40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0). This slope had been discussed as\na potential risk during the initial ascent, and as a result the up-track and descent\nroute were strategically made on the opposite side of the glacier. (This was the one\nfactor that probably averted total disaster, because the main funnel of the avalanche\nmissed us. Our group was caught in the leftmost fan of the slide, looking up.)\n    The following risk factors were unsupportive of our decision to ski a second\nrun. The time of day, particularly in context with time of year (late April), were not\nideal. The snowpack history was marked by a persistent weak layer deep in the\nsnowpack (consisting of November facets and depth hoar). These conditions had\nset up a low-probability, high-consequence scenario through most of the moun-\ntain ranges of British Columbia, particularly throughout the East Columbia and\nRocky Mountains. The steep slope adjacent to our ski run, although not impressive,\nheld avalanche potential.\n    Our group discussed to a significant extent the pros and cons of undertaking\nor aborting a second run. Most of the factors above were brought up, although our\nconfidence collectively had been bolstered regarding the persistent weak layer,\nbased on our field observations. Some in the group were markedly reserved; others\nwere motivated for a second run, including myself. After several minutes of indeci-\nsion, the group collectively decided to go ahead.\n    In situations like the one described, where objective evidence of heightened\nrisk is relatively low, subjective factors can play an important role in mitigating un-\nnecessary risk and accident. Err toward the side of caution rather than confidence.\nA combination of fitness, motivational factors, and of course good weather caused\nour group, in particular myself, to overlook important human factors that should\nhave weighed more heavily in the final decision.

Rundle Traverse\nThere were four separate rescues of uninjured but stranded groups of climbers on\nthe Rundle Traverse in the summer of 2017. This 18-kilometer (11-mile) traverse fol-\nlows a ridge across the many summits of Mt. Rundle. The terrain is mostly scram-\nbling, which increases in difficulty from east to west in both route-finding and\ntechnical climbing (low fifth class). It is usually done in one very long day.\n    All of the rescues were in the more technical sections of the ridge, which can\nrequire some roped climbing as well as rappels, depending on experience and\ncomfort level. Some of the parties had lengths of rope and a small rack, and some\ndid not. All of the parties called for help by cell phone later in the day and were\nevacuated via helicopter long line, either that evening or at dawn the next day.\n\nANALYSIS\nAll of these groups said the route was much harder and longer than they expected.\nPeople often go light to traverse Rundle and may not bring as much gear as they\nmight carry normally. The difficulties are encountered past the halfway mark along\nthe traverse, so the ease of a \u201cforward retreat\u201d could be a factor in decision making:\nClimbers elect to keep going rather than turn around and risk being benighted. (All\nparties should carry enough gear for an unexpected night out.) Limestone is notori-\nously tricky for route-finding if climbers are not accustomed to that type of terrain,\nand online descriptions often are inadequate. These parties had cell phones and were\nable to initiate a rescue. However, from other nearby areas cell phones may not work,\nand emergency satellite devices would be required to call for assistance.\n\n",

        "Incident_Type": "ALASKA\nFALL ON ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Loose Rock\nLake Clark National Park, Hidden Mountains\nFour climbers set out to explore the little-known Hidden Mountains in Lake Clark\nNational Park in June. Their goal was to make first ascents of peaks in this remote\nregion by climbing rock routes in single-push style. The day of the accident, the\nclimbers had split into two parties, opting to climb neighboring ridgelines on the\nsame peak. With a two-day window of stable weather, they each planned to ascend\napproximately 1,500 feet of class 4 and 5 terrain to the summit. Both parties carried\nGarmin inReach devices, making satellite texts possible.\n   On the evening of June 23, Emmett Lyman, 40, was 150 feet from his belayer, lead-\ning a pitch of approximately 5.7, around 800 feet above the start of the route. At 8\np.m., his belayer, Sarah Keyes, heard sizable rockfall and an inaudible reaction from\nEmmett. Sarah felt the rope tighten, presumably arresting Emmett\u2019s fall. She could\nnot see Emmett but tried to initiate verbal communication and received no response.\n   After approximately 10 minutes, Sarah contacted the other members of the\nparty, Alissa Doherty and John Gassel, via inReach. Alissa and John were 300 to 400\nfeet above and to the left of the injured party and immediately began a traverse and\ndescent in an attempt to reach him. Meanwhile, Sarah initiated the team\u2019s emergency\nresponse plan by contacting Global Rescue and the expedition\u2019s emergency contact.\nShe tied off the brake strand of the belay rope to free her hands but did not move\nor attempt to transfer the loaded rope to the anchor, out of concern that moving\nEmmett might cause additional rockfall or injury.\n   While making their descent, Alissa and John established visual and verbal commu-\nnication with Emmett, who was unconscious but responsive to verbal stimulation.\n Realizing they would be unable to reach him directly, they descended to the anchor\nwhere Sarah was belaying, reaching this point at approximately 1:45 a.m.\n    At this time, the climbers heard an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter responding to\ntheir distress call, piloted by rescuers from Elmendorf Air Force Base\u2019s 210th Rescue\nSquadron. A thick fog obscured the peak, and the climbers were unable to establish\nvisual contact with the helicopter. After an initial search, the helicopter dropped\noff three pararescue specialists at the climbers\u2019 base camp and departed to refuel.\n    During this time, Alissa belayed John up the rock to reach Emmett. John built\nan anchor above the gear that had arrested Emmett\u2019s fall and rappelled to him. He\nconfirmed their assumption of head and neck trauma, covered Emmett with warm\nlayers, and continued communicating with him while waiting for the helicopter to return.\n    At the anchor below, Alissa and Sarah established visual and verbal communication\nwith the pararescue team in base camp, and they relayed the climbers\u2019 location to\nthe pilots. After two stalled attempts to navigate in thick fog, the helicopter retrieved\nthe pararescue team and started upward toward the injured climber.\n    Once in position, a pararescueman descended via hoist line, and John helped the\nrescuer reach the cliff. The line was attached to the injured climber\u2019s harness. Due to\nthe helicopter\u2019s proximity to the cliff and Emmett\u2019s suspended position, spine stabi-\nlization was not possible. Emmett was hoisted into the helicopter at approximately\n5 a.m., and rescuers began immediate medical treatment. He was flown to a hospital\nin Anchorage and was in surgery by 6 a.m.\n    The injured climber survived the accident and evacuation, having sustained two\nfractured vertebrae, spinal cord injury, closed head injury with associated traumatic\nbrain injury, and an open fracture of his right arm. Sarah, Alissa, and John descended\nvia rappel and returned to base camp at approximately 10 a.m. on June 24. They flew\nout the next day.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe injured climber had placed adequate gear (approximately 10 pieces in 150 feet),\nand his fall was arrested by the last piece he placed (a medium-sized nut). The fall\ndistance was 20 to 30 feet. He was climbing within his technical ability and was wear-\ning a helmet, which was lost when he received trauma to the head.\n   We believe that loose rock was responsible for the accident. Emmett likely\nweighted a loose or broken block, which in turn dislodged other rocks while also\ncausing him to fall. A similar accident might be avoided by selecting objectives with\nhigh-quality rock or by retreating when loose rock is encountered.\n   This rescue was extremely well coordinated and executed. We were extraordi-\nnarily fortunate to receive specialized helicopter assistance within 10 hours of the\naccident. This expediency was unusual, given our remote location, and should not be\ncounted on in any circumstances. In our case, light winds and a brief clearing of the\nfog on the mountain, along with efficient decision-making within the Alaska Rescue\nCoordination Center (AKRCC), were critical to the speed of the operation.\n   We owe deep gratitude to the AKRCC and the pilots and pararescue specialists\nfrom the 210th, 211th, and 212th squadrons at Elmendorf Air Force Base. Staff Sergeant\nAdam Brister was nominated for the Airman\u2019s Medal in recognition of his heroism\nduring the rescue. (Source: Alissa Doherty.)\n",

This was the first day of clearing following a\nstorm that had lasted more than a week. Their objective was to climb and then ski an\neast-facing couloir on Denali\u2019s Reality Ridge. According to interviews with the team,\nas the skiers neared the top of the couloir, they began to have concerns about the\nsnow stability. The preceding storm had deposited six feet of new snow in the area.\n    The team decided to stop their ascent, cross the couloir to a spot where they could\nput on their skis, and begin their descent. During this transition, a 31-year-old male\nin the group triggered an avalanche and was swept approximately 1,800 feet down\nthe chute. The skier finally stopped at the bottom of the couloir, fortunately on top\nof the snow. Although he did not report losing consciousness during this accident,\nhe sustained significant injuries. His partners, who were above him at the time of\nthe avalanche, witnessed the entire event and were able to descend to his location.\n    Following a brief assessment, the team contacted their air taxi service via satel-\nlite phone and began to assist their injured partner back to camp. At 5:45 p.m., NPS\nrangers were notified of the incident and began planning for a rescue. Operations\nwere streamlined due to direct satellite communications with the skiers, who provided\nfrequent updates on the patient\u2019s progress toward camp and current medical condition.\n    Mountaineering rangers departed Talkeenta by helicopter and made contact\nwith the patient at 7:09 p.m. Once back in Talkeetna, the patient was transferred to\nan ambulance at 7:47 p.m. and taken to a local hospital. He had suffered a dislocated\nleft shoulder, a fractured jaw, a large chin laceration, and large contusions on the\nright thigh and right elbow.\n\nANALYSIS\nMay 3 was a single day of clearing weather between two large storm systems, last-\ning eight days and six days, respectively. During each of these storms, significant\nsnowfall accumulated in the Alaska Range, raising the potential for natural and\nhuman-triggered avalanches. Although anyone would be eager to get out of the tent\nand climb or ski after an extended storm, it is paramount to remain vigilant to one\u2019s\navalanche assessment and safe travel practices, regardless of the external pressures\nand the human factors that influence decision-making.\n   This party\u2019s decision to carry a satellite phone with them on the climb\u2014and not\nsimply stow the phone at base camp\u2014facilitated a swift and effective rescue.

The fall occurred at 3:30 p.m. on May 20. The 29-year-old\nfemale and 27-year-old male climbers were roped together at the time of the fall,\n but with hard surface snow conditions and\nwithout any protection clipped between\nthem, they were unable to arrest their\nfall. They slid about 1,000 feet and into a\ncrevasse on the Peters Glacier.\n    A guided climbing team witnessed this\nincident and made the initial report to NPS\nrangers stationed at 14,200-foot camp. In\naddition, one of the fallen climbers was\nable to signal for help with a personal loca-\ntor beacon (PLB), which relayed their loca-\ntion at approximately 15,800 feet to both\nthe Alaska Rescue Coordination Center\nand NPS personnel in Talkeetna.\n    An NPS ranger patrol descending from\n17,200-foot camp on the West Buttress\nresponded to the site of the initial fall.

Multiple contingency plans were\ndrafted in Talkeetna and on the mountain to accommodate rescuer safety in the\ndynamic weather conditions on the upper mountain. A rescue attempt by helicopter\nthat evening turned around due to high winds and poor visibility.\n    Early on May 21, as ground rescue teams started toward the fixed lines that gain\nthe West Buttress, they encountered the male patient limping into 14,200-foot\ncamp with an injured knee. During the night, despite his injury, he had climbed back\nover the West Buttress and descended the fixed lines toward 14,200-foot camp. He\nreported that his climbing partner was alert and stable but injured and non-ambu-\nlatory in the crevasse that had stopped their fall.\n    A ground rescue team and the NPS helicopter team arrived at the injured patient\u2019s\nlocation at nearly the same time. She was assessed, immobilized for suspected\nspinal injuries, and extracted via short-haul back to 14,200-foot camp. After a flight\nto Talkeetna, she was transferred to an Anchorage hospital via air ambulance for\ntreatment of cervical spine fractures. The patient\u2019s climbing partner was evacuated\nby helicopter the following day due to his unstable knee injury.\n\nANALYSIS\nRoped glacier travel can provide a false sense of security. Failure to adapt fall protec-\ntion methods to the current surface conditions has been the cause of many accidents.\nThis is especially true when the surface becomes too firm for effective self-arrest.\nIn softer snow conditions, where self-arresting is possible, solid footwork and using\na mountaineering axe may be sufficient protection. As the surface hardens or tran-\nsitions to ice, running protection (e.g. pickets or ice screws) is required to arrest a\nfalling team member. The transition from soft to hard footing may be subtle, and\n conservative risk management strategies should be employed. The icy and rocky\nterrain of the West Buttress ridge is a location that requires running protection to\neffectively arrest a fall.

Hunter, Mini-Moonflower\nOn May 20, Britt Ruegger, 34, and I (age 29) were climbing the Mini-Moonflower Route\nwhen a debris avalanche swept the route and hit us as we were rappelling. We\u2019d arrived\nat KIA (Kahiltna International Airport) on May 8 and proceeded to log some tent time\nduring mixed weather. We climbed the first three or four pitches of the Mini-Moonflower\non May 14 but bailed due to building snow. On May 20 we set out to give it another go.\n    In base camp that morning there was a trace of new snow, but by the time we\nwere about 30 minutes from the base of the route we observed a foot of fresh snow,\nlikely due to micro-orographic effects and temperature differences. I was a bit\nuneasy about how much new snow had fallen, but the weather didn\u2019t seem bad that\nday, and no new snow was forecast until the afternoon, which would give us time to\nclimb most of the route.\n                                         At the base of the climb I felt some apprehen-\n                                     sion, but sometimes you don\u2019t know until you\n                                     go. We set off, swapping leads up eight or nine\n                                     pitches. As we got within a pitch or two of the\n                                     ridgeline, we decided to pull the plug because it\n                                     seemed like the weather was turning.\n                                         We began to rappel. Above the crux pitch, we\n                                     threaded the ropes through an in situ V-thread\n                                     anchor and backed that up with an ice screw.

At this point, since I still had more\n                                     rope available, I had the choice to build a thread\n                                     there or continue down. I continued another 10\n                                     to 15 meters to an angled shelf, making the rappel\n                                     about 40 to 45 meters. I built a two-screw and\n                                     quad anchor at the semi-hanging stance and\n                                     clipped in with my tether. It was around 8:30\n                                     p.m. As I was preparing to pull the ropes out of\n                                     my rappel device, I heard a rumble and looked up\n                                     to see an avalanche headed at me. I grabbed the\n                                     anchor and hoped for the best.\n                                         The avalanche pummeled me and knocked me\nLooking down the Mini-Moonflower off the stance. After it had passed and I got back\nRoute at the stance where a climber\n                                     on my feet, I realized something was wrong. When\nwas hit by an avalanche during a\nrappel descent, knocking him off the\n                                     I reached up to finish removing the ropes from my\nstance and breaking his arm.

Either something carried by the slide or\n the force of being knocked off my stance had broken my left humerus at mid-shaft.\nLuckily, my partner was only dusted by the avalanche.\n    I placed my left wrist in a climbing sling and we continued our descent, which had\nits own challenges, including a stuck rope. While my partner solved that problem, I\nactivated the SOS on his Garmin inReach device, 30 or 40 minutes after the avalanche.\nOnce we reached the glacier, the NPS helicopter shuttled us to base camp, and in the\nevening I was flown to Talkeetna and a waiting ambulance. I had surgery later that night.\n\nANALYSIS\nWe don\u2019t know what caused the avalanche above us, but we hadn\u2019t adhered to the old\nadage of waiting at least a day after a storm to let the slopes shed snow, and perhaps\nwe were threading the needle in regard to the weather pattern. We didn\u2019t really get\nmuch sleep the night before, which may have contributed to missing or not paying\nenough attention to telltale signs during the approach.\n   Although we both were carrying Garmin inReach devices, in the debrief with\nthe NPS rangers we learned that, since we were so close to Kahiltna base, carrying\na Talkabout-style radio would have allowed direct comms with the rangers at base\ncamp.

Other\nclimbers in the vicinity had administered two doses of dexamethasone, a steroid\nused to treat HACE, in hopes the climber could continue his descent. The severity\nof the patient\u2019s condition made a ground rescue from 17,200-foot camp impractical.\n    The NPS helicopter was flown from Talkeetna just after midnight on June 2. A\nmountaineering ranger was picked up at 14,200-foot camp for a reconnaissance,\nand the climbing team of three, including the patient, was located at approximately\n18,500 feet on the West Buttress Route, near Zebra Rocks. The helicopter returned\nto 14,200-foot camp, where a rescue basket was rigged to the short-haul line. The\npilot extracted the patient and returned to 14,200-foot camp at 12:45 a.m. The patient\nand an NPS volunteer medic then flew to Talkeetna.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe difficulty of rescue at high altitudes should always underscore one\u2019s risk assessment\nand decision-making. As soon as weather, climbing conditions, or a climber\u2019s health dete-\nriorate high on the mountain, climbers should retreat. The likelihood of a rescue often\ndiminishes with each step higher in elevation.

This 40-year-old male had\nbeen pulled from his tent when his climbing partner found him experiencing seizures\nwhile cooking in their tent during a storm. The responding mountaineering ranger\nand his team found the patient was initially responsive only to painful stimuli, but\nafter 30 minutes of oxygen therapy he had returned to normal mental status.\n    Both this patient and his climbing partner, a 44-year-old male, were found to be\nsuffering from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The partner had exited their tent\nwhen \u201cfeeling off\u201d and thus was able to alert others that his partner had become\nunresponsive.\n   Both of these patients required constant treatment and monitoring until the\nweather cleared two days later. At this time, both climbers were flown to town\nand taken to the hospital for further testing and treatment for acute and chronic\nCO poisoning. During their stay in the NPS medical tent, the patients received\nalternating treatment with supplemental oxygen and hyperbaric therapy in the\nPortable Altitude Chamber in hopes of expediting the removal of CO from their\nred blood cells.\n\nANALYSIS\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a life threat for mountaineers, especially when weather\nconditions force climbers to seek shelter while cooking. The outcome of this inci-\ndent could have been catastrophic had one of the climbers not responded to his\n\u201cunwell feeling\u201d by exiting the tent for fresh air. The changes to a patient exposed to\ncarbon monoxide can be subtle and often unrecognized by those exposed, as initially\nthe signs and symptoms may mimic the effects of altitude or general unwellness.\nAdequate ventilation should always be the priority when cooking in an enclosed\nspace such as a tent.

Once\nabove Denali Pass, winds were estimated at a consistent 15 to 20 mph, with occasional\ngusts of 25 to 30 mph.\u201d These observations were consistent with other climber and\nNPS ranger reports that day. At 10 p.m., the wind increased and visibility decreased\non the upper mountain while the guided team was descending the peak.\n    At 2:30 a.m. on June 5, mountaineering rangers at 17,200-foot camp were noti-\nfied that two climbers on this guided expedition had returned to camp with frost-\nbite injuries sustained during their summit climb and needed medical assistance.\nThe rangers assessed both patients and deemed that one required urgent evacua-\ntion. The 53-year-old male had deep frostbite injuries to all ten fingers, all ten toes,\nand his nose. The patient believed that most of the frostbite occurred during the slow\ndescent to camp; he reported that his fingers had frozen when he removed his mittens\nto manipulate the carabiners on snow pickets. The NPS team worked throughout the\nnight to rewarm the affected extremities on both patients while awaiting flyable weather.\n    At 9:37 a.m., the NPS helicopter flew to high camp and evacuated the 53-year-old\npatient to base camp, where he was transferred to an air ambulance and ultimately\ntransferred directly to the frostbite specialists at the University of Utah Burn Center\nin Salt Lake City for advanced treatment. Subsequent reports revealed that this climber\nhad nearly all of the frostbitten tissue amputated during the course of his care.\n    Following the evacuation of the first patient, the second patient, a 31-year-old\nmale, was also flown from high camp due to deep frostbite injury on one of his feet.\nThe ranger team was concerned that this climber could not descend safely on the\nfrostbitten limb and opted to evacuate in order to prevent further injury.\n\n ANALYSIS\nDeep frostbite injuries often have long-term consequences. It is essential for climbers\nto actively rewarm body parts that become cold while traveling in alpine conditions.\nWhen environmental circumstances prevent the rewarming of these body parts,\nclimbers must seek shelter or descend to a more hospitable location to prevent\nfurther injury. Keep in mind that if a frozen body part is thawed, refreezing must\nbe prevented, as this will increase the severity of the original injury. (Source: Denali\nMountaineering Rangers.)",

        "Incident_Type": "MT. SHASTA ANNUAL SUMMARY-2018",
        "Details_Factors": "\nMt. Shasta and Castle Crags Wilderness\nIn 2018 there were eight climbing-related accidents on Mt. Shasta. Four were due\nto falls on ice or snow, two were due to rockfall, and one was the result of glissading\nwith crampons; little information is available about the eighth incident. In addition,\nthere were numerous searches involving lost climbers (see note below). Despite a total\nof 20 search and rescue incidents on the mountain\u2014well above the recent annual\naverage\u2014there were no fatalities in 2018.\n    On May 12, a female climber, age 32, fell and slid a reported 1,000 feet in Avalanche\nGulch after lunging for a dropped cell phone to prevent it from sliding down the steep,\nfirm slope. She suffered a fractured ankle and multiple scrapes and bruises. She was\nwearing crampons and had an ice axe. Gale-force winds and strong downdrafts on\nthe mountain prevented a helicopter rescue, so rangers and volunteers brought her\ndown Avalanche Gulch in a toboggan, a process taking many hours. This incident\ncould have been easily prevented by focusing on the task at hand rather than multi-\ntasking in terrain with fall potential.\n    On May 14, a 65-year-old male climber was struck in the head by rockfall while\ndescending Avalanche Gulch near the Heart. He had been wearing a helmet, but had\ntaken it off to adjust the headband or liner when he was hit. The climber momen-\ntarily lost consciousness but was able to self-rescue. He suffered a two-inch scalp\nlaceration to the back of his head.\n    An 18-year-old male attempted to glissade down the Avalanche Gulch on June\n18 while wearing crampons. Near the Heart, his crampons stuck in the snow and he\nsuffered a broken ankle. Rangers continually attempt to educate climbers regarding\nproper glissade technique\u2014including never glissading with crampons\u2014but each year\nthis type of accident still occurs.\n     On June 23, a male climber (age unknown) fell an unknown distance in Avalanche\nGulch. The climber was able to self-rescue with the help of his partners. He sustained\nmajor abrasions to his buttocks and back. A second accident on June 23 occurred\non the west face. A novice male climber (mid-30s) fell approximately 1,500 feet after\na slip while off-route; he attempted to self-arrest but lost control of his axe. His fall\nwas witnessed by a Shasta Mountain Guides employee, who assisted the climber after\nthe fall. The climber suffered a broken heel, a broken small toe, a sprained ankle, and\nan unspecified knee injury.\n    A 29-year-old male climber was climbing the Avalanche Gulch route early on the\nmorning of June 30 when a large rock came tumbling over the Red Banks and struck\nthe climber in the ankle, resulting in a short fall. The climber was unable to walk, and\nhis ankle was slightly angulated, indicating a likely ankle fracture. His partners and\nother climbers improvised a litter with a closed-cell foam sleeping pad and various\npieces of webbing and were able to self-rescue, dragging the injured climber down\nto Helen Lake. He was then loaded onboard an Army National Guard helicopter and\ntransferred to a local medical facility.\n    On July 1, a 49-year-old male climber slipped while downclimbing through Red\nBanks. He fell approximately 200 feet and sustained facial lacerations and abrasions\nbut no other significant injuries. He was able to continue his descent, along with his\nclimbing partners, without issue. At the end of July, a female climber broke her leg at\napproximately 11,500 feet. Additional information is unknown, but it is presumed she fell.\n\nANALYSIS\nSearch and rescue incidents nearly doubled from the year before. That said, condi-\ntions on Shasta were never abnormally dangerous. Most incidents on the mountain\ninvolve either slips and falls on steep snow and failing to self-arrest or climbers\ngetting lost. Learning to self-arrest and knowing how to navigate are essential skills\nfor wilderness and mountaineering, not just on Shasta but anywhere in the world.\n     The rangers often talk about \u201cmountain sense\u201d to\nclimbers. This is a hard topic to teach, but mountain\nsense involves making good decisions based on your\npersonal and/or group knowledge, skills, and abilities.\nIt\u2019s listening to that little voice in your head and forc-\ning \u201csummit fever\u201d to the side when the conditions,\nweather, visibility, or the group\u2019s fitness and readiness\naren\u2019t optimal. (Source: Mt. Shasta and Castle Crags\nWilderness 2018 Climbing Ranger Report.)\n\nLOST CLIMBERS ON SHASTA: In addition to the inci-\ndents described above, there were seven cases in 2018\ninvolving lost climbers. Climbers most often get off-\nroute on the upper mountain, above around 12,500\n                                                          Example of route-finding info\nfeet.

Smartphone mapping applications can work\nvery well; a simple recommendation is to learn to use one of these apps and how to\nuse your phone to provide lat/long coordinates to rescue personnel. An extra charge\nstick (battery) for your phone is a great idea too.\n    In 2018, there were three false alarms or accidental activations of Satellite Emer-\ngency Notification Devices (SEND devices), such as the Garmin inReach and SPOT\nMessenger. It is essential for climbers to secure these devices to prevent false alarms,\nwhich waste valuable resources that may be needed for actual emergencies. (Source:\nMt.

        "Incident_Type": "LEDGE FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection, Speed Climbing\nYosemite National Park, El Capitan, The Nose\nOn May 3, Hans Florine and a climbing partner started a climb of the Nose of El\nCapitan at approximately 7 a.m. Both are highly experienced. Florine has made over\n100 ascents of the Nose and has held the speed record on the route; his partner had\nclimbed El Cap multiple times, including speed ascents of the Nose with Florine. The\ntwo were planning to do the route in 10 to 12 hours.\n    At some point in the first half of the climb, the team dropped a gear sling that\ncontained some of their smaller cams, leaving them with only a set of small nuts and\nCamalots 0.5 and larger. The two decided that it was reasonable to continue up the\nroute, improvising in spots with the gear that they had.\n    On pace for a 12-hour time, the team arrived at the Pancake Flake (pitch 22) with\nFlorine in the lead. To move quickly through such technical terrain, the team was\n\u201cshort fixing.\u201d This technique involves pulling up the excess rope at the end of a pitch\nand fixing it for the second to jumar. The leader then self-belays into the next pitch\nuntil he runs out of rope or his partner arrives at the anchor and puts the leader on a\nnormal belay. This is an advanced speed climbing technique that saves time but can\nincrease risk to the leader.\n    After climbing the initial hand crack on Pancake Flake, Florine arrived at Triangle\nLedge, a stance that marks the start of a thin crack just before the next anchor. Not\nhaving the ideal gear for this section, Florine started up the corner, placing three\nsmall nuts and one cam. His next piece, a nut, failed when he weighted it. He fell\napproximately 20 feet, striking Triangle Ledge along the way, before the cam he had\nplaced arrested his fall. He was still self-belaying at the time.\n    Both legs were injured in the fall (a pilon fracture in one leg and a shattered calca-\nneus in the other). The climbers were unable to rappel the route because of Florine\u2019s\ninjuries. He pulled himself up onto Triangle Ledge and had already called 911 for help\nby the time his partner arrived at the anchor below.\n    Due to the non-life-threatening nature of the injuries as well as high winds, it was\ndecided that a \u201ctop down\u201d rescue was the safest option for accessing the patient. The\nplan was to shuttle the SAR team and gear to a landing site on top of El Cap using a\nhelicopter. Then the decision to raise Florine to the top or lower him to the bottom\nwould be made, based on environmental conditions at the time.\n    While talking to the SAR team on the phone, Florine asked about trying to rappel\nto a larger ledge where pain management would be easier. It was decided by both\n parties that rappelling to the\nGray Ledges, about 300 to 400\nfeet below the site of the acci-\ndent, was the best option.\n   By 7 p.m., rescuers had\nreached the climbers, and soon\nthe decision was made to raise\nthe patient to the summit. After\nbeing treated for pain and pack-\naged into a litter, a long-hauling\noperation began, and at approx-\nimately 10 p.m., Florine and\n                                    Yosemite rangers Brandon Latham (left) and Philip Johnson,\nthe two rescue team members having lowered from the top of El Capitan, arrive at Gray\narrived at the summit. (Florine\u2019s Ledges to retrieve Hans Florine (right). Hans Florine\npartner rappelled to the base of El\nCapitan.) The patient spent the night on top of the Nose with the SAR team, receiving\nmedical care from paramedics. Early the next day, he was flown down to El Cap Meadow.\n\nANALYSIS\n   Protect yourself over ledges. While a 20-foot fall in overhanging terrain or on\na blank wall can present little risk, any ledge or protrusion can introduce serious\nconsequences. If climbing above a ledge, place gear early and often.\n   Reassess risks during a climb. After dropping the gear sling with the smaller\ncams, the team could have chosen to turn around. Although both climbers were very\nknowledgeable about the terrain above, the loss of those pieces of protection greatly\nenhanced the seriousness of the upper part of the climb.\n   Speed climbing. Speed climbing techniques\u2014and mindset\u2014can put climbers at\ngreater risk. Less gear, non-standard belay techniques, and haste add risk and conse-\nquences to already difficult climbs.

        "Incident_Type": "LOWERING ERROR",
        "Details_Factors": "Inexperience, No Stopper Knot\nYosemite Valley, Reed\u2019s Pinnacle\nOn May 7 two climbers headed to the route Lunatic Fringe (single-pitch 5.10c). The\nleader was fairly experienced (four to five years), and the belayer had about 1.5 years of\nexperience. The two had climbed together the day before in the Valley. Lunatic Fringe\nwas at the leader\u2019s limit for traditional lead climbing in the area, and he hung twice while\non the route. After arriving at the anchors, the leader clipped in direct and then pulled\nhis blue 65-meter rope up through the gear he had placed and dropped an end back\ndown to the belayer. The leader then tagged up a second rope (green 60-meter). The\nclimb is roughly 43 to 45 meters high and requires two ropes to rappel or top-rope.\n    Once the leader had hauled up the green line, he tied the ends together using a\nflat overhand with a backup. He rigged the knot on the side of the anchor that would\nallow the green line to be pulled to retrieve the two ropes. At this moment, the leader\n was perfectly set up to rappel to the ground safely. Instead, he tied a bight in the\ngreen rope approximately one meter below the joined ends and clipped this to his\nharness with a locking carabiner. (Rock & Ice magazine reported that he had forgot-\nten his rappel device and thus decided to lower instead of rappel.) He unclipped from\nthe anchor and asked the belayer to lower him with the blue rope that was threaded\nthrough the anchor; essentially he would be lowering on his single 65-meter lead\nrope. When the end of the blue rope reached the belayer, it passed through her tube-\nstyle device and the leader fell approximately 10 meters to the ground. He suffered\nnumerous serious injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nRappelling from these anchors with two ropes tied together is the preferred option. If\nthe leader forgot his rappel device, he could have asked the belayer to tie it to a rope\nand then hauled it up. Instead, the leader switched plans to lower but did not have a\ngood understanding of the consequences of his chosen method, nor did he and the\nbelayer communicate clearly about the new plan. Despite the faulty lowering plan,\nclosing the belay system still could have prevented the leader\u2019s ground fall. A knot was\nfound at the end of the green line, but the blue rope (on which the leader effectively\nwas lowering) had no stopper knot and was not tied to the belayer.

        "Incident_Type": "STRANDED ON DESCENT",
        "Details_Factors": "Off-Route, Fatigue\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, East Ledges\nOn two days in a row in early June, YOSAR responded to climbers stranded after\nfailing to make their way down the East Ledges descent from the top of El Capitan,\nwhich requires a mix of rappelling and scrambling.\n    The first party had climbed the East Buttress route on June 2 and attempted to\nfollow the \u201cOption C\u201d descent shown in the popular Supertopo guidebook. However,\nthis descent requires two ropes to rappel and the team only had one. After one rappel,\nthe party found a two-bolt rappel station and assumed they were at the correct loca-\ntion. They pulled their single line and committed to that descent. After rappelling\nagain, they became stranded on a ledge.\n    The team had cell phone service and called YOSAR. Due to the late hour, they\nwere instructed to wait on the ledge for rescue in the morning. Two YOSAR members\nresponded to the East Ledges and assisted the party down.\n    Later that same day, two more East Buttress climbers were stranded on the East\nLedges rappels. They had followed rock cairns and a faint climbers\u2019 trail leading\ntoward the edge of El Capitan. At some point the team found a manzanita bush with\nwebbing and rappel rings and began rappelling from that location. At the end of the\nfirst rappel, they found bolted rappel anchors at a ledge, which led them to believe\nthey were on the standard rappel route.\n    After pulling their single 60-meter rope, one member of the party rappelled down\n30 meters, only to find there were no more rappel stations on the blank face. He used\nprusiks to ascend the ropes to his partner, but the terrain above them was far beyond\ntheir ability to climb back up to the rim.\n    The next morning, two SAR-siters climbed up the East Ledges, located the two\nclimbers, and gave them a tutorial on how to use ascending devices. The climbers\nthen ascended a fixed rope with a belay from above.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climbers involved were experienced in multi-pitch climbing, but had never\ndescended off El Cap. They told SAR personnel that they were tired after climbing\ntheir routes and that haste played a big factor in these incidents. Slow down and\nthink things through toward the end of the day. When fatigue has set in, it is easier\nto make mistakes.\n    When rappelling into unknown terrain, it is imperative to continuously analyze\nyour situation. If you observe that you would be unable to climb back up the terrain\nyou\u2019re rappelling, be certain you can continue down with the equipment you have\nbefore pulling the ropes above you. (When you commit to climbing with only one\nrope, your descent options are severely limited. If you are not familiar with a descent,\nconsider bringing two ropes the first time. Even though guidebooks show a number\nof options for rappelling the East Ledges, only one option is possible with a single\nrope.) Often, leaving gear to create your own rappel anchors is a feasible option.\n    When continuing down is impossible, it\u2019s important to know the techniques for\nascending ropes. The climber in the June 3 incident had these skills and was able\nto spend the night on a ledge as opposed to hanging at the end of a rope. (Source:\nYosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection, Rope Severed\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan\nAround 6 a.m. on the morning of June 2, Tim Klein, Kevin Prince, and Jason Wells\nstarted up El Capitan with the objective of climbing the Salath\u00e9 Wall (VI 5.9 C2) in a\nday. All three were very familiar with the terrain. Klein had climbed El Capitan 108\ntimes, Wells over 90 times, and Prince roughly 20 times. The full team had climbed\ntogether previously, including a one-day ascent of the Salath\u00e9 four years prior.\nAdditionally, Klein and Wells had an estimated 40 one-day ascents of the Salath\u00e9,\nincluding a sub-eight-hour ascent.\n    On the day of the accident, the trio\u2019s goal was not a speed record but simply to\nenjoy an in-a-day ascent, with Wells and Prince attempting to free climb the route.\nTo be efficient, the team was short-fixing, an advanced climbing technique popular\namong speed climbers on El Capitan. This consists of the leader climbing a pitch,\npulling up the slack, fixing the lead line for the follower, and then continuing either\non self-belay or without a belay with the remainder of the available rope. The follower\nascends the fixed lead line and upon arriving at the anchor places the leader back\non a standard belay.\n    Because they were climbing as a team of three, the second climber was tagging\n(trailing) an additional rope behind him and fixing it at each belay anchor. The third\nclimber then would self-belay on this rope using progress-capture devices (e.g.,\nMicro Traxion).\n    Early that morning, around Triangle Ledge, the trio caught and passed a party\n                                                                    attempting a multi-day ascent of Golden\n Mammoth Terraces   10\n                                                                   Gate.

NPS Photo                was positioned at the pitch seven anchor, in\n                                                                   view of the area below Mammoth Terraces,\n         saw Wells in mid-fall. The climber then heard Klein yell and saw him come into view,\n         also falling. The climber said he saw the fall briefly arrested before the rope appar-\n         ently failed. The two fell approximately 1,000 feet to the base of El Capitan.\n                Upon reaching the anchor above the Half Dollar, Prince waited for the Golden\n         Gate team to reach him. Once they arrived, Prince tied in with them, and the three\n         retreated to the base of the wall. By the time they got to the ground, YOSAR person-\n         nel were on scene and had confirmed Klein and Wells did not survive the fall.\n\n      ANALYSIS\n      There are many unknowns about the accident. No one was able to see the moment\n      the climbers began falling or the specific events leading up to it. What follows explains\n      the findings at the scene as well as possible.\n          Upon reaching the anchor atop the Half Dollar, Prince found that his rope (the\n      one Klein had trailed) had been short-fixed to two bolts. The remainder of this rope\n      extended approximately 50 to 60 feet to a point where it ended at a number 2 Camalot\n      clipped with a locking carabiner in the locked position. The Camalot was not placed\n      at a significant ledge and was judged by investigators to be a temporary placement.\n          According to Prince, this had not been part of the team\u2019s plan; at every other\n      belay, Klein had stayed connected to Prince\u2019s rope. Leaving Prince\u2019s rope at the cam\n      suggests that Klein may have needed to move higher on the wall than Prince\u2019s rope\n      would reach (although he would have needed to retreat to Prince\u2019s line at some point\n      to retrieve it) or that he had needed to move back down the wall and had decided\n      to leave Prince\u2019s line at his high point. It is also possible that Wells and Klein met at\n      the top of pitch eight (atop the Half Dollar) and then Wells may have carried Prince\u2019s\n      rope to fix at the location of the number 2 Camalot.\n     Wells was likely combining pitches nine and ten into a single pitch, thus avoid-\ning the need to build a gear anchor at the top of pitch nine. Doing this would have\nmeant that Klein would not have had enough rope to stay at the two-bolt anchor\nand belay at the top of the Half Dollar. However, it was determined by investigators\nthat a 60-meter rope would reach the bolted anchor atop Mammoth Terraces from\nthe location of the number 2 Camalot.\n    The rope was cleanly severed within a foot of Klein\u2019s harness. The investigation\nfound boulders about 40 feet directly below the number 2 Camalot that showed\nevidence of sheath and core rope material. Approximately 40 feet above the Cama-\nlot, a block was found with rope fibers on two sides, indicating the fall may have been\nmomentarily arrested at this location.\n    No protection was found placed in the rock leading to Mammoth. Because the rope\ncut during the fall, there is a chance that gear had been placed, failed, and was lost off\nthe end of the rope when it cut. However, the evidence suggests this was not the case.\n    Three unattached cams were found at the base of El Capitan near Wells. Multiple\ncams were attached to Wells\u2019 right gear loops. Both gear loops on the left side of\nWells\u2019 harness were broken, and investigators determined that the cams found at the\nbase likely detached from Wells\u2019 harness during the fall. (No gear was found on the\nroute during a follow-up patrol.) The total number of cams accounted for was consistent\nwith the total that Prince believed the team brought for the climb. If so, the two climb-\ners would not have had either a belay or any protection between them when they fell.\n    A few reporting parties stated they had seen a haul bag drop off the Shield head-\nwall (above this area of the Salath\u00e9) just before the accident. Extensive follow-up\nfound these claims to be untrue. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)\n    Editor\u2019s note: The mysterious and unplanned number 2 cam placement suggests\nthat one of the climbers may have tied off the trail rope while dealing with a contin-\ngency above or below that point. Perhaps the rope between Wells and Klein got stuck or a\npiece of gear was dropped. It\u2019s possible that one climber fell while attempting to solve this\nunknown problem and then his fall pulled off the other. The full story will never be known.",

At approximately 7 a.m.,\nclimber 1 (female, age unknown) slipped while ascending \u201cThe Chute,\u201d a snowfield\noften used as a shortcut in early season when the main route is under snow. The\nChute gains about 1,200 feet, rejoining the main trail around 13,600 feet. At the time\nof the accident, the snow surface was likely hard or icy.\n    Climber 1 was ascending the snowfield, reportedly without crampons or an ice\naxe, when she lost her balance and began sliding. She was unable to self-arrest and\ntumbled down the slope, colliding with climber 2 (female, age unknown) and then\nclimber 3 (male, age unknown), who reportedly reached out to try to stop the fall-\ning climbers and sustained a spinal injury in the ensuing collision. Climbers 1 and 2\ncame to a stop approximately 150 feet apart and on 30\u00b0 terrain after falling almost\n500 feet in elevation.\n    Climbers 1 and 2 suffered a number of injuries, including major head and facial\ntrauma and pelvic and spine injuries. Other climbers, whose aid was essential to the\noperation, stabilized the patients\u2019 positions, preventing them from sliding farther\ndown the slope. A California Highway Patrol helicopter ferried members of the Inyo\nSAR team to the accident site, where they treated Climbers 1 and 2 and packaged\nthem for transport and hoist evacuation.

While resting by a small alpine lake, we heard cries for help. We\nheaded up the talus field under the north ridge of Conness, following the screams.\nBefore long I located a 21-year-old male, Adrien Costa, who had been making a solo\nattempt on a direct line up to the north ridge. At around 11,400 feet, a large piece of\nunstable talus had shifted and fallen onto his leg, just above the knee, trapping him.\nThe incident occurred at approximately 12:45 p.m. It was now 1 p.m.\n    Primary assessment revealed a crushing\ninjury to the right leg caused by the granite\nblock, which was roughly 5x5x1 feet in size\nand weighed about two tons. There was no\nsensation or mobility below the injury but\nslow capillary refill in the calf. The femur,\nknee, and lower leg all had significant defor-\nmity. The patient had significant bleeding\nfrom the site of the injury that appeared to\nbe arterial. He was alert and oriented with\nstable vitals and but severe pain. I applied\nan improvised tourniquet with a small piece\nof rope and a carabiner at 1:05 p.m. and acti-\nvated my SPOT device. (It was later deter-\nmined the device never sent the message\ndespite it reporting a successful transmis-\n                                                  Preparing to move a two-ton talus block from\nsion.)

Sam England\nwho called for help on their cell phone.\n    We provided fluids to Adrien, but he had no appetite for food. The tourniquet\nsuccessfully stopped the bleeding, and his vitals and level of consciousness were stable.\nAt 4 p.m., unsure of whether help was coming, I left Kimberly with Adrien and began\nhiking toward the car, planning to call 911 and then return to the accident site with bivy\ngear. After 20 minutes, I intercepted a Mono County Sheriff\u2019s Department SAR team\nand escorted them to the site, where they took over the scene at roughly 4:45 p.m.\n    The SAR team called the National Guard for a helicopter extraction. Meanwhile,\nthey rigged a 9:1 ratchet system to prepare to move the boulder, as well as other\nsystems to stabilize the stone once it was moved. A Blackhawk helicopter arrived and\nlowered a flight paramedic, who took over medical intervention. Once the helicopter\nhad burned enough fuel to accommodate the weight of the patient, the boulder was\nmoved off Adrien, six hours after he became trapped. He was packaged into a litter\nand carried over the talus and onto the glacier, where he and the medic were winched\ninto the helicopter and flown out. Adrien\u2019s leg was later amputated above the knee.\n\nANALYSIS\nI am unaware of the events leading up to the accident, as we arrived shortly after\nit happened. Obviously, care should be taken when crossing loose talus. Although\n Adrien was not on the traditional route to the north ridge of Conness, I believe he\nintended to take the line he followed. There are risks in climbing alone.

This climber\nhad belayed his partner (female, 38) down this passage and was downclimbing to her\nwhen he fell. He ended up in a low-angled scree- and talus-covered area at 13,400\nfeet. The party had a personal locator beacon (PLB), which was activated immediately.\n    An air search located a headlamp high on Thunderbolt Peak that evening, but\ndue to waning daylight and high altitude, no rescue was possible at that time. On\nthe morning of August 27, the Inyo County Sheriff\u2019s Office initiated a helicopter\nresponse. The crew reported strong and turbulent winds near the climbers\u2019 location\nthat prevented them from approaching the party or landing below their position.\nAfter picking up an Inyo County Search and Rescue team member, the helicopter\ncrew found that westerly updrafts near the ridge crest would permit them to lower\nthe Inyo SAR member onto the ridge at 13,800 feet.

It lies on the\nnorth side of the South Fork of the Kings River, just outside of Kings Canyon National\nPark. The rock is marble, which can have notoriously bad sections.\u00a0\u00a0\n    After a search for the best looking rock on the cliff, Vitaliy took the first pitch, and\nAdam and I followed up to a small stance. I started hesitantly up the second pitch,\ntesting the rock carefully before every move. When I reached a short bulge, I placed\na bolt above the lip, as there was no adequate protection nearby. I placed a number\n3 Camalot about four feet above the bolt, and the rock quality improved noticeably.\n There was a nice ledge ahead, with a number 3 size crack above it, so I reached down\nand back-cleaned the Camalot below my feet before continuing.\n    There were a couple of thin moves before the ledge. After knocking on one grape-\nfruit-size hold, I could tell it wasn\u2019t super solid, but the climbing was less than verti-\ncal so I thought it would stay in place if I didn\u2019t pull out on it. However, as I began to\ntransfer my weight, the hold came loose. My reflex was to push the rock back into\nposition to keep it from hitting my partners or the rope. This worked, but I came off\nand began sliding down the rock with my hands extended straight up and my toes\npointing straight down. After falling about 15 feet, I hit a small ledge about the size of a\nlicense plate. I bounced off this ledge and fell six feet more before the rope caught me.\n    Only the balls of my feet had hit the small stance, which forced my toes toward\nmy shins. The tendon of my calf muscle (flexor hallucis longus) in both legs tightened\nuntil it fractured the inside of my calcaneous in my left foot and shattered the calca-\nneous in my right foot. My feet quickly swelled and I had to remove my shoes. Vitaliy\nand Adam lowered me to their stance, then down to the ground with our other rope.\n    Vitaliy is an emergency department nurse, and Adam is a physical therapist, and\nthey made the wise suggestion that we use my emergency beacon to call for help.\nHowever, I was not comfortable with asking rescuers to try to reach me in this windy\ncanyon without a life-threatening injury, so I put tape on my hands and started scoot-\ning down the gully toward the river. Adam and Vitaliy carried all the gear, setting\nrappels on the sections that were too steep to scoot. They carried me across the\nKings River, and I crawled the remaining stretch up to the road.\n\nANALYSIS\nI made a beginner mistake: I knew there was a chance of loose rock, and yet I was\nmoving quickly to make up for lost time. If I had not back-cleaned the cam (or had\nbrought more protection), I would have stopped falling above the impact point. I am\ngenerally very careful to protect routes to avoid hitting the ground or ledges, but\nwas not as careful as I should have been here. A tiny ledge can have the same effect\nas a large ledge if you hit it wrong. (Source: Daniel Jeffcoach.)",

Besides\nbeing well back from the edge of the cliff, the bolts also are slightly below the edge,\ncausing rappel ropes to bend more than 90\u00b0 and resulting in significant friction.\n    After word got out about the stranded August climbers, Black Gold\u2019s first ascen-\nsionist added temporary warning tags to the bolts, one saying \u201cNO RAPPEL HERE\u201d and\nthe other \u201cRAPPEL PLAYIN HOOKY,\u201d with an arrow pointing to the climber\u2019s left. (The\nPlayin\u2019 Hooky top anchor is about 25 feet to the left.) When asked why they ignored\nthese tags, one of the October climbers replied, \u201cWe thought the tag meant not to\nuse that specific bolt.\u201d [User-friendly rappel anchors now are in place for this route.]\nIn addition to the possibility of rappelling the neighboring line, there is a walk-off\nfrom the top that follows a climbers\u2019 trail north and around the top of the obvious\ngully, then down the next gully to the east.\n    Situational awareness is an acquired skill, gained through experience, but the\nprocess can be accelerated by climbing with skilled instructors and experienced\nmentors. With a little extra knowledge and gear, the climbers likely would have been\nable to recognize the problems with this anchor, identify a rope that might get stuck\n(conducting a pull test once over the edge), or deal with a stuck rope (carrying prusiks\nto ascend back up). In addition, carrying an extra layer, especially in spring and fall,\ncan add some comfort when things do not go according to plan. (Sources: Dale Atkins\nand Curt Honcharik, Alpine Rescue Team.)",

[Editor\u2019s note: The\nguidebook actually says to climb to the first bolt before starting the Robbins Traverse.]\n    I started leading the fifth pitch, climbing an ar\u00eate for 10 to 15 feet, and clipped the\nfirst piton I saw. I had read that if taking the traverse variation it\u2019s best to extend the\nrunner on the first piton to reduce rope drag. I clipped the piton with a double-length\nsling, then backed up the piton with a number 1 Metolius Ultralight Master Cam a\nfoot to the left in a horizontal crack. I double extended the cam as well to reduce any\nform of rope drag. I then moved left into the exposed traverse.\n    Immediately, the climbing was more insecure than anything we had done on the\nlower pitches (up to 5.9+). I slowly moved up and left, then made three or four moves\nto advance five vertical feet. I scanned for protection placements, but there were\nnone. I started to feel fatigued, saw what looked like a shallow, chalk-dusted horn up\nto my right, just beyond a static reach, and committed to throwing for it. I missed.\n    What I remember next is the feeling of free fall, air quickly filling the top of my\nchest, then a second later I opened my eyes and was hanging next to Alex, slightly\nbelow the belay ledge. I saw blood on the wall beneath me and on my hands. I had\nfallen 30 to 40 feet and was unconscious for three minutes. Alex tells me that I fell\non him, hit the small belay stance, then slammed against a wall before I was arrested\nby the rope. The back of my helmet was cracked. According to Alex, once my fall was\narrested, I started convulsing for around 30 seconds, then my body went limp as I\nhung from my harness 10 feet below him.\n    Alex extended his anchor tether and managed to pull me up next to him and clip\nme to the anchor. He used his shirt to apply pressure on my head and reduce the\nbleeding, and he called 911 and yelled to other climbers at the base of the wall to do\nthe same. At around 6:30 p.m., Rocky Mountain Rescue Group rappelled in and began\nto help us down. We reached the ground at around 9:30 p.m. With assistance I was\nable to walk out of the canyon.\n    I was diagnosed with a concussion, intracranial hemorrhage, a large laceration\non the back left side of my head, which required 14 staples to mend, and a puncture\nwound in my left calf. I recovered fully.\n\nANALYSIS\nBefore any route, especially a traditional multi-pitch route, no matter how classic or\nwell-traveled, always do as much research as possible to prevent getting off route. I\nnow know that I moved left for the traverse way too early. This lack of due diligence\nwas the cause of my accident. I am very grateful for my partner\u2019s quick reaction and\nfor keeping me alive, and to the volunteers of Rocky Mountain Rescue Group for\ngetting me down. I am also glad I was wearing a helmet, which undoubtedly saved\nme from a more serious head injury or potential death.

In this case, the lack of chalk, lack of protection, and unexpected\ndifficulties each could have been red flags on such a well-traveled, reasonably protected\nclimb. When the \u201coff route\u201d signs start flashing, it\u2019s better to downclimb to a stance,\nregroup, and study the alternatives than to go for it and hope for the best.\n",

Sam, a 5.10 sport climber and begin-\nner trad climber, was attempting to lead Tower Crack (5.7), an offwidth crack in an\ninside corner. When first climbed in 1935 by Fritz Wiessner, Tower Crack was among\nthe hardest rock climbs in the country. Sam was confident, having previously followed\nTower Crack and having led crack climbs of similar difficulty.\n    Sam approached the crack by climbing up Wiessner\u2019s Slab for about 70 feet to the\nlarge horizontal ledge below the upper offwidth corner. He placed a large cam (size\nunknown) at the bottom of the corner and a number 0.3 Black Diamond Camalot in\na crack in a side wall higher up. While attempting to move up the climb, he fell twice\nonto the small cam without injury. On his third attempt at the crux, he fell again and\npulled out the 0.3, hitting a ledge and spraining his left ankle. He and his partner were\nable to rappel to the ground and hike out.

It may have shifted from the prior falls, the\nclimber bumping the piece as he moved past it in bulky wintertime clothing, or due\nto the use of a short quickdraw. Anytime you fall onto a piece, reassess its placement\nand ensure it is still good. Micro-cams, like the 0.3 that pulled out, have particularly\nsmall margins for error.

According\nto his belayer, Jake McCrary (32), Seamus hit a boulder at the base of the climb and\ncontinued falling down an embankment roughly 20 feet. McCrary called 911 while\nanother member of their climbing party, a physician assistant, began first aid. Wolfe\nCounty Search and Rescue responded, and Hehir was airlifted to a Level I trauma\ncenter in Lexington. He sustained a broken back, a broken neck, and a head lacera-\ntion. He was not wearing a helmet.\n    Due to the nature of the injuries, the climber has little memory of the accident or\nsetting up the rappel. The climbers at the base of the route removed Hehir\u2019s rappel\n device from his harness after he fell, and McCrary said that only one line was clipped\nthrough the tube-style device. After the incident, the rope ran from the base up\nthrough the quickdraws on the route and then down to the climber on the ground,\nbut it was not threaded through the anchors. McCrary concluded that Hehir had\nonly clipped his device with the side of the rope that ran from the ground through\nthe draws, then pulled the other side through the anchors during his fall. Hehir typi-\ncally cleans routes by rappel and says that he regularly attaches an autoblock, but\ndoes not recall if he used an autoblock in this instance. McCrary is also unsure if he\nremoved an autoblock following the incident.\n\nANALYSIS\nFrom the accounts of the event, it seems as if only one strand of the rappel rope\nwas threaded through the tube-style rappel device and clipped to Hehir\u2019s harness\nwith a locking carabiner. As noted above, he may have used an autoblock backup,\nbut autoblocks are not effective safeguards when the two strands of rappel ropes\nare pulling in opposite directions, as they would when a rappeller fails to clip both\nstrands properly.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection, Fatigue\nCrawford Notch, Mt. Willard\nOn February 23, a local climbing guide, age 64, took his client to Mt. Willard, a popu-\nlar area for moderate, multi-pitch ice climbs. The weather was warm, and by early\nafternoon freezing rain was falling. At around 1 p.m., the guide short-roped his client\nacross a talus slope to the base of Left Hand Monkey Wrench (WI3). He placed a\nstubby screw on the climb\u2019s initial 20-foot traverse in order to protect his client and\nthen placed one 13cm screw about halfway up the pitch. He headed into the narrow\nchoke at the top of the climb, where he considered placing a third screw to protect\nthe exit but did not do so. As he topped out the climb, his tool popped and he fell:\nfirst 20 feet onto a bench below the choke, and then an additional 20 feet. The upper\n13cm screw and the belayer held his fall. The impact fractured the climber\u2019s right\nfemur just below the hip and broke his right elbow in three places.\n    The guide instructed his client to tie a catastrophe knot in the belay rope to\nprevent him from falling further. She then ascended to his position using his weight\nas a counterbalance. He had come to rest in a nook in the ice, and the pair was able\nto work the injured guide into his emergency tarp to guard against hypothermia.\nThey called his guiding service, and members of Mountain Rescue Service (MRS) and\nother guides who were on adjacent climbs rushed over to help. MRS was able to build\n an anchor to transfer the injured guide into a litter and then lower him through the\ntalus and down the remaining 400 feet of steep approach gully. From there he was\ncarried to the road, arriving around 7:30 p.m.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe length and severity of the guide\u2019s fall can be attributed to not placing a screw\nbefore the final section of climbing on the pitch. The climber was more than qualified\nfor the difficulty of the terrain and moving quickly because he was guiding. He attri-\nbutes the fall to late-season tiredness and not judging his own physical state properly\nbefore heading out. These factors are common in accidents involving guides, who will\noften climb quickly and without adequate protection on easy, familiar terrain. Such\naccidents often occur late in the day when guides are mentally exhausted.\n    Though the Mt. Willard area is more or less a roadside crag, the steepness of the\napproach and its positioning\u2014at the apex of windy Crawford Notch\u2014means that\ncarrying a light emergency shelter (such as the guide\u2019s tarp) is prudent. Climbers in\nmountainous terrain also should carry a communication device that will allow them\nto call for help when cell phone service is nonexistent.

Washington, Tuckerman Ravine\nAt about 1 p.m. on February 24, a climber took a long sliding fall while ascending near\nthe top of Right Gully in Tuckerman Ravine. The subject slipped on very hard, icy\nsnow and was unable to self-arrest with an ice axe. The resulting high-speed slide\nwas halted below the gully by exposed bushes and rocks. The fall totaled approxi-\nmately 300 vertical feet.\n    With the help of a climbing partner, the subject was able to walk down to Hermit\nLake, from which U.S. Forest Service Snow Rangers transported the subject via\nsnowmobile to Pinkham Notch. The primary injury was presumed to be bruised or\nfractured ribs.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe subject and witnesses to this accident unanimously were surprised the outcome\nwas not more serious. The subject was indeed lucky to slide into a generally bushy\narea as opposed to the many nearby rocks that would have likely resulted in greater\ninjuries. Further, the subject was not wearing a helmet and was very fortunate to\navoid hitting the head. The party had climbed Right Gully several times before, and\nother than the lack of helmets they were properly equipped with mountaineering\nboots, crampons, and ice axes.\n    While firm conditions can inspire confidence for climbers traveling uphill with\ncrampons, it can be incredibly difficult to arrest a fall once sliding with any amount of\nspeed, even with skilled use of an ice axe. It is better to prevent falls in the first place\nwith solid snow climbing skills and careful movement.

Washington, Hillman\u2019s Highway\nOn February 25, after climbing two-thirds of the way up Hillman\u2019s Highway and not\nfinding a ton of good snow, our group transitioned for an icy ski descent. There was\na small ribbon of wind slab on the skiers\u2019 right side of the slide. My two partners\nsideslipped the ice to a good point of safety. I tried the wind slab, but after a few\nuntrustworthy turns, I bailed for the more predictable icy surface. However, on my\nsecond turn, I went down and started to slide.\n    I have practiced self-arresting on snow with a Whippet [self-arrest pole grip]\nand skis on, but not on ice. I tried to self-arrest with no luck. I slid for about 200 feet\nbefore managing to slow myself down in some soft snow piled on top of a rock. Unfor-\ntunately, as I came to a stop, I fell off the side of the rock, landing on my shoulder and\ndislocating it. My partners and I tried to reset the joint with no luck.

        "Incident_Type": "MANY AVALANCHES",
        "Details_Factors": "\nMt. Washington, Tuckerman Ravine\nOn April 7, seven avalanches occurred in Tuckerman Ravine. All were human trig-\ngered. At least five people were caught in one of the avalanches.\n    In the week leading up to April 7, there were two rain events. The first was March\n29\u201330, delivering 0.75 inch of rain, followed by 0.32 inch of rain on April 4. Both of\nthese were followed by hard freezes. On Friday, April 6, light snow showers began just\nafter noon and continued through sunrise the following day. Hermit Lake recorded\n16cm (6.3\u201d) of snow, while between 7 and 8 inches was estimated at the summit. When\nsnowfall began on Friday, wind at the summit was around 30 mph from the south.\nOvernight, wind direction shifted to the west and speeds increased to 60\u201370 mph.\nThe weather on Saturday was clearing skies, winds diminishing to around 40 mph\nfrom the west, and temperatures in the single digits on the summit and reaching\ninto the 20s (F) at Hermit Lake. This weather pattern built a robust melt-freeze crust,\nover which touchy wind slab was built from the new snow.\n    During the morning of April 7, three avalanches were intentionally triggered by\nskiers. All three were ski cuts, two occurring in Lobster Claw and one on the rollover\nof the Little Headwall. Slab depths were up to 14 inches, and all slides occurred on a\nlayer of softer snow immediately above the melt-freeze crust.\n    Other avalanches occurred in Left Gully and Chute, both of which were triggered\n unintentionally. We believe that no one was caught or\ncarried by either avalanche.\n    Two avalanches in Hillman\u2019s Highway this day\ninvolved a number of people being caught and\ncarried. At approximately 2 p.m., at least 40 people\nwere climbing and skiing in Hillman\u2019s. An individual\nclimbing uphill from the right fork into the left fork\ntriggered the initial avalanche. This person was not\ncarried in the slide. The crown was approximately\n300 feet below the top of Hillman\u2019s, and the slide ran\ntwo-thirds of the way down. At least five people were\ncaught and carried. USFS snow rangers responded to\nthe incident and identified one injured skier who was\n                                                        Fracture line of a slab avalanche in\ntransported to Pinkham Notch with a back injury that Hillman\u2019s Highway that caught at\nwas not life-threatening. Another individual sustained least five people. Kurt Schleicher\na minor injury to the hand.\n    The second avalanche was triggered around 2:30 p.m., within minutes of the initial\nsnow ranger team arriving on scene. The consensus of bystanders is that this second\navalanche was triggered by the same individual who triggered the first, after topping\nout on the ridge and beginning to ski the hang-fire slab above the initial crown. This\nsecond avalanche was smaller and luckily did not capture any people.\n\nANALYSIS\nMany opportunities for learning are presented by this day, which fortunately did not\ninvolve more serious injuries. First, it\u2019s an excellent reminder that avalanche condi-\ntions can develop on Mt. Washington during the normally stable spring months, which\nbring crowds of backcountry skiers to Tuckerman Ravine. On days with conditions\nlike those on April 7, anyone venturing into avalanche terrain should bring a beacon,\nshovel, probe, and the knowledge to use them effectively.\n     A cardinal rule for traveling in avalanche terrain is to move one at a time through areas\nexposed to avalanche danger. Despite the often-heard phrase \u201cIt\u2019s just Hillman\u2019s,\u201d all of\nHillman\u2019s Highway is avalanche terrain. On top of that, it\u2019s particularly confined. Had only\none person at a time been exposed in Hillman\u2019s on April 7, it\u2019s likely that nobody would\nhave been injured. On a slope as large as Hillman\u2019s, a number of people can travel on\nthe slope before someone finds the specific location that will trigger an avalanche.\nIn other words, tracks on a slope do not mean it\u2019s safe to ski or climb.\n     Finally, we should touch on ski cutting. The process of intentionally skiing a\nspecific part of a slope likely to trigger an avalanche, with speed, from one safe zone\nto another, is an advanced practice and is only appropriate under certain conditions.\nIt is only wise when you possess a high degree of certainty about what the ski cut\nwill produce and the consequences if you\u2019re wrong. In particular, ski cutting is inap-\npropriate when an avalanche may initiate above you. On April 7, the individual ski\ncutting on Lobster Claw and Little Headwall was a professional skier who had high\ncertainty both in terms of anticipated result and the consequences for being wrong,\nand avalanches above were nearly impossible. Further, other people were not in the\npotential avalanche run-out zones. (Source: Mount Washington Avalanche Center.)",

In November, I (male, 34) was rappelling on a single 70-meter,\n7.8mm half rope with a second rope on my back. Before I began navigating down a\n100-foot vertical cactus garden, I tied an autoblock and knots in the end of my rope,\nbecause objective hazards were apparent and abundant. With the sun setting, I was\ntrying to move fast and link rappels, skipping the anchor atop the first pitch, but as I\nrappelled over an overhang, I realized the rope ends were dangling 10 feet above the\nledge where the climb had begun. This ledge sits above a 150-foot approach slab, so\nI couldn\u2019t risk downclimbing the remaining 10 feet to the ledge\u2014a fall would likely\nbe fatal.\n    I decided to ascend the ropes by simply pulling up on the rope strands and pull-\ning the slack through my ATC. After one such attempt, the rotten lip of the over-\nhang, over which the ropes were running, broke off and hit my left hand (my brake\nhand). I estimate the rotten mass of granite that crashed against me weighed 50 to\n60 pounds, falling about five feet before hitting me. I immediately realized that my\nthumb was shattered, but I wasn\u2019t sure if other bones were broken. I never lost control\nof the ropes with my brake hand. If I had, the autoblock should have prevented a fatal\nground fall.\n    With blood pouring out of my smashed thumb, and the autoblock already tied, I\nquickly set a cam in an adjacent rotten crack, clipped into it, set a fist jam with my\nnon-broken hand, got my feet on a positive stance, and removed the ropes from\nmy ATC.

        "Incident_Type": "NEW YORK\nLEADER FALL ON ICE",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate protection, Poor Position\nAdirondacks, Pitchoff Mountain, North Face\nOn December 27, at approximately 9 a.m., my brother Don Heinz (51) and I (46) were\nclimbing Arm and Hammer (WI3+) with two friends. It was a cold day (10\u00b0 F), but there\nhad been a recent stretch of warm weather and rain. We\u2019d talked about canceling the\ntrip, given the recent weather, but decided to climb anyway.\n    Don led the climb and headed up a 70-foot section of 50\u00b0 ice to the crux, a 15-foot\nvertical section. He placed several screws on the low-angle start and placed another\nat the base of the crux before continuing up toward what he thought was solid ice.\nThe ice sounded hollow, so he continued to climb, looking for better ice and planning\nto rest in a large slot at the top of the crux section. This slot was eight to ten feet tall\nand had been melted by rainwater. I had noted to myself that the ice looked bad in\nthat spot but didn\u2019t mention it to my brother.\n    My belay was in a blind spot, so I couldn\u2019t see him climb into that area, but as he\nentered the V-shaped slot, he found more bad ice and continued up and left without\nplacing another screw. Near the top of the vertical stretch, Don\u2019s left axe blew from\nthe ice. He fell and hit the low-angle section of ice below, then continued to slide\nbefore coming to a stop hanging upside down from a screw.\n    No one saw him land, but his injuries suggest he impacted the ice on his left\nhip and back, then hit his head. He was unresponsive despite my screams from the\nbelay. He regained consciousness after five minutes but was initially only able to\nmake guttural noises, and I worried that he might be choking on blood. An AMGA-\ncertified rock guide who was descending the neighboring route at the time of the\naccident traversed over to our route to help Don off the wall. At this point, Don was\nconscious but visibly confused and unstable. I lowered Don to the ground as the\nguide descended with him.\n    At the base, Don could not remember anything. He complained of pain in his left\nhip/back and his right shoulder. He had a puncture wound in his left side caused by\n an ice screw racked on his harness. We sheltered him with our puffy jackets, placed\na backpack underneath him, and wrapped him in an emergency blanket provided by\nthe guide. A member of our party called 911 and contacted the Adirondacks forest\nrangers. They arrived within 90 minutes of the fall, packaged Don in a litter, and\nlowered him down the steep hill to a point where he could be transferred to an\nambulance. A helicopter then transported him to a trauma unit in Albany. His most\nserious injuries included a puncture wound and chip in his left hip where the tooth\nof the screw penetrated to the bone, three vertebrae fractures, three broken ribs on\nthe right side, and a fracture of his right scapula. His memory returned in 24 hours,\nand he remained in the hospital for two days.\n\nANALYSIS\nBetween the recent weather and the obvious signs of melting, there were reasons\nto be concerned about the condition of the ice. A quick conversation regarding the\npoor ice in the slot might have alerted Don to stay away from it. A belay that provided\nline-of-sight to Don as he climbed also could have prevented the accident, as I would\nhave had the opportunity to warn Don about the ice in that area.\n    As Don climbed the crux, he passed opportunities to place higher protection in the\nvertical ice section. A screw there may have prevented him from hitting the low-angle\nice below the crux. Given the condition of the ice, Don should have downclimbed\ninstead of continuing to run it out above a ledge. Don\u2019s recollection is that the last\nscrew was eight to ten feet below him and several feet to the left when he fell, which\nwould have resulted in a long fall even with a tight belay. After the accident, we were\nslow to call 911, as we were somewhat in shock.\n    Despite the accident, there was a lot we did right. Don\u2019s helmet clearly saved him\nfrom a very serious head injury, and the highest screw he placed saved him from a\nmuch more severe fall. Once Don was on the ground, our efforts to keep him warm\nwere successful and prevented the situation from deteriorating further, given the\ncold weather. We were very fortunate to have the immediate assistance of a guide\nand the rangers. (Source: Joe Heinz.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Unclipped from Anchor\nShawangunks, Trapps\nOn October 10, three climbers finished the second (last) pitch of Baby (5.6). The leader\n(male, 31) was using a half-rope system, with each follower tied to an end of each\nhalf rope. The leader arrived at the bolted rappel station, clove-hitched himself to\nthe ring anchors using the half ropes and two carabiners, and built a master point by\ntying an overhand onto the two strands of rope. This was different from his normal\nroutine, which used a cordelette for a belay anchor while securing himself using a\npersonal anchor system.\n   Once the rest of the party arrived, they clipped themselves to the anchor with\ntheir personal tethers. As the leader began dismantling the anchor to set up the\nrappel, he suddenly realized he was unattached to the anchor in any way. Luckily,\nthe team was standing on a small ledge, so the issue was corrected and the party\ndescended safely. (Source: Anonymous report from the leader.)\n ANALYSIS\nThe leader\u2019s analysis of the incident: \u201cThis\nhappened because I deviated from my usual\npattern of climbing and untied out of habit\u2026\nnot noticing that the rope was acting as my\npersonal anchor.\u201d Another member of the party\nnoted that, for himself, \u201ceven when he builds\nthe master point with the rope, he prefers to\nnot anchor himself with the rope, because\nmaking sure you don\u2019t unanchor yourself is\none more thing to worry about when you\u2019re\nsetting up rappels and lowers.\u201d Good habits are\nimportant, and it can be helpful to rely on the\nsame proven and well-understood anchoring\nsystem. However, climbers confront a host of\nvariables\u2014available tools, weather, rock quality,\nother climbers\u2014and safety is best served with\na flexible set of methods that may be effective\nacross a broad spectrum of scenarios.

        "Details_Factors": "\nMohonk Preserve\nIn 2018 there were 23 reported climbing-related accidents. Injuries included five\ntraumatic head injuries, one spinal fracture, several long-bone fractures, three\nopen fractures of the lower legs, and minor ankle, wrist, shoulder, and hand injuries.\nThirteen accidents required technical rescue, including six high-angle rescues. Two\nfatalities occurred after climbers fell a distance of greater than 60 feet to the ground.\n    Two climbers were injured when a top-rope anchor system failed on Herdy Gerdy\n(5.6) in the Trapps. One of the climbers fell around 20 feet to the ground, landing on\nanother person sitting at the base. The climber suffered fractured vertebrae, and\nboth suffered additional minor injuries. Upon inspection, Mohonk Preserve rangers\nfound that the climber had set up the top-rope using hardware store webbing for\nthe anchor system and clothesline as the belay rope.\n    While attempting to lead Nice 5.9 in the Trapps, a climber fell and suffered a trau-\nmatic brain injury. The climber had only placed two pieces of protection during the\nclimb, the first about ten feet off the ground and the second at roughly 25 feet. The\nclimber fell at the crux, and the higher piece failed to hold, resulting in an uncon-\ntrolled fall to the ground. The climber was wearing a hard-shell helmet.\n    A climber suffered kneecap, lower leg, and wrist fractures after a ground fall\n from the top of the \u201cAMC Slab\u201d in the Trapps. The climber was untethered to a safety\nsystem while cleaning the anchor site. Damp conditions at the time caused the rock\nto be slick.\n    A climber died after suffering multiple systems trauma in an uncontrolled fall of\napproximately 80 feet from Grand Traverse Ledge. The climber and their partner\nhad just completed the first pitch of Arrow (5.8) in the Trapps and swapped gear on\nthe GT Ledge. A decision was made to build a new anchor below the second pitch,\nwhich required a short walk across the ledge. Still tied in but not belayed, the climber\nlost their footing and fell off the ledge. The partner attempted to arrest the fall by\ngrabbing the rope and sustained third-degree burns to the hands in the attempt.\n    Another fatal fall took place in the High Exposure area of the Trapps. The fall was not\nwitnessed by climbers, so the exact climb being attempted and the cause are unknown.\nInspection by Mohonk Preserve rangers found the climber wearing a harness with an\nATC attached, along with a rope coiled and tied to the back. This suggests the climber\nintended to use the rappel stations nearby for descent upon completing a route. The\nabsence of any additional gear suggested the climber had been free soloing.\n    In the Peters Kill area, a climber suffered a traumatic open fracture of the right\nankle when an accident occurred during a top-rope lower. The climber had completed\na 5.6 route on the Bunk Bed Wall and asked the belayer to lower him. The belayer fed\nrope out before ensuring the climber\u2019s weight was on the system. Upon leaning back,\nthe climber fell about 15 feet before the belay held, resulting in an impact with a ledge.\nOnce on scene, Mohonk Preserve rangers found the climber sitting on a small ledge\nabout 40 feet up, still tied into the top-rope system. The belayer had disconnected\nthe belay in an attempt to scramble up the cliff to provide aid. Rangers secured the\npatient to an anchor system, provided care, and executed a high-angle rescue.\n    A climber suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall on Anguish (5.8) in the\nTrapps. Starting the third pitch, the climber fell approximately 20 feet before the\nbelay caught and swung the climber into the cliff face. The climber was unrespon-\nsive while hanging below the belayer. The partner tied off the system and contacted\nemergency services. Once on the scene, rangers found the patient had regained\nconsciousness but was unable to communicate. Rangers hauled the patient to Grand\nTraverse Ledge and then moved a short distance to the anchors on Three Pines (5.3)\nfor lowering. The climber\u2019s foam helmet had broken in several places in the fall.\n    While leading the second pitch of Modern Times (5.8+) in the Trapps, a climber\nsuffered injuries to the rib cage during a fall. The climber was approximately 20 feet\ndiagonally up from the last piece of protection, resulting in a large pendulum swing\ninto the cliff. Rangers stabilized the climber\u2019s injuries and lowered them from Grand\nTraverse Ledge to the ground.\n\nANALYSIS\nSeveral accidents in 2018 likely would have had much worse outcomes if climbers\nwere not wearing a helmet at the time they fell. Additionally, several accidents might\nhave been avoided completely if climbers had been attached to a safety line or been\non belay in exposed locations. In several accidents, additional protection could have\nmitigated the damage from falls when the last piece of protection failed to hold.\n(Source: Andrew Bajardi, Chief Ranger of the Mohonk Preserve.)",

Climber 1 (male, early 20s) was shirtless with his hands on his head and blood\n streaming down his head and face. There were numerous abrasions on his torso. I\nimmediately lowered my climbing partner to the ground, and a nearby pair of climb-\ners came over to assist. One of them was a doctor. I retrieved my first-aid kit from my\npack and the doctor donned gloves and attended to Climber 1\u2019s head injury. He had a\nsevere laceration on his scalp but seemed alert and responsive. Very eager to get to\nthe hospital, Climber 1 and Climber 2, his belayer (male, early 20s), were still wear-\ning climbing shoes and had left all of their gear behind. My partner and I retrieved\ntheir walking shoes and offered to collect their gear while they went to the hospital.\n    The two had been attempting Black Rain, a 5.9 sport route. Earlier in the day, we\nhad climbed the same route, which has six bolts and a large intermediate ledge. Many\nof the routes that day were wet from recent rains and mist. While we were able to\nsend the route, we struggled to find good stances on the slippery rock, and my hand\npopped off several times, resulting in moderate lead falls.\n\nANALYSIS\nBased on what we saw when we retrieved their gear, Climber 1\u2019s fall occurred above\nthe ledge while attempting to clip the fourth bolt. Based on his description, he\nfell while clipping, landed on the ledge and struck his head (he was not wearing a\nhelmet), then fell off the ledge. While cleaning their gear we noticed that several of\nthe quickdraws were not clipped in the safest manner, including one that was back\nclipped.

        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Assess Conditions\nMt. Hood, South Side\nAt approximately 10 a.m. on May 26, an experienced skier (male, 35), attempted a ski\ndescent of the Mazama Chute on the upper south slopes of Mt. Hood after reaching\nthe summit. Following many days of warm conditions, the night of May 25 had been\ncolder, with temperatures below freezing on the upper mountain. The snow surface\nwas hard frozen corn\u2014very firm and difficult to ski. According to witnesses, after\ntwo or three turns the subject fell and lost both skis. He tumbled about 400 feet, the\nfull distance from Mazama Chute to Hot Rocks.\n    Hot Rocks was still partially covered with snow, and the upper transition from snow\nto rock consisted of multiple transverse crevasses. The subject flew across the first\nlarge crevasse, then fell vertically 20 feet off an ice edge, coming to rest in a trough\non a snow shelf. He experienced extensive injuries from the fall and narrowly missed\nsliding off the shelf to the rocks below. His final location was precarious, with precipi-\ntous drop-offs just three feet from his landing point. His skis were lost in a crevasse.\n    Other climbers who witnessed the fall called 911. A team of four rescuers from\nPortland Mountain Rescue (PMR) was on the mountain that morning, and they\nreached the subject around 11 a.m. By that time, others climbers were assisting the\ninjured climber, including an internal medicine resident from a local hospital.\n    The climber\u2019s location at the edge of an ice cliff above an active fumarole compli-\ncated evacuation and required more rigging and rescue personnel than the initial\nfour rescuers could provide. While waiting for a larger team to arrive, the PMR team\nset anchors above and rigged a rope system that could be used to pendulum a litter\nand attendants across steep snow immediately above the ice cliff.\n     Attempts to recover the patient with a helicopter from an Oregon Army National\nGuard unit were thwarted by wind and turbulence. Instead, the patient was evacu-\nated by penduluming the litter across a snow slope to the Hogsback. From there,\nrescuers lowered the litter some 1,500 feet to where it could be managed by unas-\nsisted litter attendants. The injured climber was transferred to a snow cat at the top\nof the Palmer lift at approximately 7 p.m. and then transported to Timberline Lodge,\nwhere he was loaded into a helicopter for transport to Portland.\n\nANALYSIS\nSkiing off Mt Hood\u2019s summit is a common objective for expert skiers. However, condi-\ntions on the upper crater are often not appropriate, safe, or fun for a ski descent. On\nthis day, the subject and his companion climbed to the summit and waited for the\nsnow to soften. Unfortunately, they judged the snow condition in the couloir based\non the exposed snow on top, which was not representative of the snow in the shaded\nchutes through the crater wall. Rather than confirming the snow had softened in the\nchute, the subject dropped in from above, only to find he could not hold an edge. He\nwas unable to arrest the resulting fall.

Hood, South Side\nOn May 28 a roped party of three climbers was descending the Pearly Gates at\napproximately 8:30 a.m. when one climber fell, pulling the others into an uncontrolled\nfall. No anchors or running protection were being\nused at the time of the fall.\n     The top climber (male, 50), who was the\nleader of the party, had wrapped excess rope\naround his body in a Kiwi coil configuration but\nhad failed to tie off the working end of the rope\nat his harness. During the fall, the leader became\nwedged in a crevasse (southeast of the berg-\nschrund) creating a virtual \u201cdead man\u201d anchor\nfor the rope team. Had the leader not become\nsnagged in the crevasse, the entire rope team\nwould have fallen another 400 to 500 feet down\nthe mountain.\n     After the fall was arrested, the leader was\nwedged in the upper crevasse, complaining of\npain and unable to extract himself. Climber 2\n(female, 48) lost a boot and crampon but reported\nthat she was okay (she was later found to have\na clavicle fracture), and Climber 3 (female, 48)\n                                                   Position of three climbers after a fall in\nwas caught on the lip of a lower crevasse with an the Pearly Gates area. All three had to be\napparent head injury. All three came to a stop on rescued, and one required a helicopter\na 50\u00b0 slope and were unable to move.               evacuation. Portland Mountain Rescue\n     A Portland Mountain Rescue (PMR) rescuer who had just begun descending the\nmountain was able to respond immediately, initiating a call for additional resources\nand coordinating a response with two mountain guides who volunteered to assist.\nCommunication with the fallen climbers was difficult, as only two of the three climb-\ners spoke any English and this was minimal.\n    One guide worked to secure the team\u2019s rope with a solid anchor to support the\nother climbers, extract the leader from the crevasse, and assess and treat his injuries.\nThe second guide assisted climber 2, who did not feel confident unclipping from the\nrope system. Her missing boot and crampon were recovered by other climbers and\nreturned to her. The PMR rescue leader attended to Climber 3, who was disoriented\nwith a possible head injury. When assessing Climber 3, the rescuer identified that she\nwas clipped into the rope with a non-locking carabiner and her harness was improp-\nerly buckled. Had the carabiner or harness failed, this climber could have fallen an\nadditional 400 feet or more.\n    Rockfall and falling ice were assessed to be an immediate threat to life, thus the\npatients had to be moved out of the hazard zone as safely and expeditiously as possi-\nble. Climber 2 was lowered first. A solid anchor was rigged above her and offset from\nthe edge of the crevasse below her, allowing the patient to be pendulumed around\nthe crevasse and then lowered down the headwall and out of danger. Climber 3 was\nlowered on the same system as Climber 2. The PMR rescue leader then returned to\nthe apex of the Hogsback and found the assisting mountain guide attempting to lower\nClimber 1 down the Hogsback. This climber did not speak any English but was clearly\nvery cold and in great pain from apparent back and shoulder injuries. Climber 1 was\nlowered another 25 to 50 feet to remove him from the highest risk of falling objects.\nAt that point, a shelf was cut into the slope to stabilize the patient.\n    Due to the severity of Climber 1\u2019s injuries, an Army Medevac Blackhawk helicop-\nter was requested to hoist him from the scene. He was flown from the Hogsback to a\nnearby hospital for treatment. Climbers 2 and 3 descended the mountain with rescu-\ners. The assistance of the two mountain guides, as well as many other climbers who\ndonated personal climbing gear and clothing, made a big difference in the rescue.\nAll should be commended for their time and generosity.\n\nANALYSIS\nThese climbers clearly lacked the expertise and experience for this route. In addition\nto the unsafe use of a rope and harness described above, witnesses reported that their\ntechnique while descending was poor. The climbers did not carry adequate gear to\nstabilize and protect each other from the elements if an accident occurred, requiring\nother climbers to donate clothing and gear to support them during the rescue. One\nclimber had medical conditions requiring them to take prescription medications,\nwhich they had reportedly not taken within the last 24 hours. They were uncertain\nof the name of the medication or dose, further complicating the rescue.\n    The lack of English made it challenging for rescuers to assess and coordinate the\nrescue. PMR asked the sheriff to find a translator, and they located a tourist at Timber-\nline Lodge who had a relative in New York who was able to assist. A teleconference\nusing speakerphone was then used to interview the patient.

Jefferson\nIn the midafternoon of July 20, Sam Lowry (age\n60) and I (Jon Sprecher, age 64) climbed the\nJefferson Park Glacier route and were descend-\ning the North Milk Creek snowfield to loop back\nto our camp via the Russell and Jefferson Park\nglaciers. This descent is usually done unroped for\nspeed, because the climbing is not too hard and if\nyou\u2019re not placing protection you\u2019d only pull off the\nother climber if you fell. It was late in the season\nand the surface was soft ice with patches of slushy\nsno-cone ice, making face-out descent difficult\ndue to the variable conditions. I was descending\nface-in, using two tools, a Black Diamond Raven\nice axe and a Chouinard alpine hammer.\n    My accident occurred when, after I\u2019d pulled Rescue helicopter approaches a climber\n                                                      on Mt. Jefferson after his night out with a\nout my axe to move down, the alpine hammer broken leg. Caleb Glaser/Ricky Yunke,\nsheared in the soft ice and I started sliding and Linn County Search and Rescue\nrotating to the right. My right crampon stuck in\nsome ice, twisting my ankle and flipping me sideways. I flipped back over and self-\narrested using the axe, stopping my slide after an additional 20 feet. I\u2019d previously\nexperienced a badly sprained ankle and quickly realized that I had a worse injury. I\ncontinued descending, kicking with one leg and \u201ckneeing in\u201d with the other before\neventually crawling on my knees for several hundred more feet down to a point that\nwas safe from rockfall. It was obvious that I wouldn\u2019t be able to complete the descent,\nso we called 911 on our one dying cell phone.\n    It was late in the day and we were forced to spend a night out, cold and sleepless.\nStill, with enough clothing, water, and food, it was \u201cokay.\u201d The next afternoon, when\nwe got tired of waiting for rescuers, my partner started down, and after an hour he\nran into the search and rescue team ascending to find us; on his description of my\ninjury, they called a helicopter for me. My injuries included a broken fibula and a\ncouple of torn high-ankle ligaments.\n\nANALYSIS\nIf I\u2019d had a second full ice axe, the pick likely would have gone in more deeply and\nnot sheared out. I am very used to climbing with the Chouinard alpine hammer that\nI was using. Even so, next time I climb in the alpine I plan on using a medium length\nice hammer with a longer pick.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nWasatch Range, Little Cottonwood Canyon\nOn Monday, June 11, my wife and I (male, age 31) went out for a casual day of climbing\nin Little Cottonwood Canyon. We headed up for a lap on Stifler\u2019s Mom (multi-pitch\n 5.11a), which we have climbed several times. Finding the route empty, we cruised on\nup, linking pitches and having a good time. My wife and I noted that the route seemed\na bit dirtier than usual, probably from spring runoff.\n    I climbed through the sixth-pitch crux overhang feeling good. I clipped the bolt\nover the roof and worked my way up the thin but relatively easy corner above, admit-\ntedly not paying very close attention to the climbing in front of me. I noticed that a\npin that used to be about halfway up the corner was no longer there. In its place, I\nplugged a red C3 Camalot, gave it a tug, and visually verified good contact on all the\nlobes. After climbing a little higher, with the C3 just below my feet, I fell.\n    I still don\u2019t know exactly why I slipped. I tried to run backwards down the slab but\ntripped over something\u2014maybe the roof or the rope. I flew over the roof and landed\non the slab below, about 10 feet below my wife at the belay ledge, facing downward,\non my right shoulder. My head whiplashed against the rock and I slid another few\nfeet before the rope caught me. In total the fall was roughly 30 to 35 feet. The C3\nhad popped, and the bolt that caught me was about eight feet below that placement.\n    I knew immediately that I\u2019d been badly hurt. I could not command my diaphragm\nto move for nearly 10 seconds. Suddenly I was able to take shallow breaths, and I\nscreamed up to my wife that I was alive but needed help. She tried to lower me to a\nledge about 20 feet lower, but stopped when I realized that I could not control my\nbody at all and I had probably injured my spine. At that point she tied me off and\nfocused on keeping me still while coordinating a way to get me off the wall.\n    Bryce and Tyler, climbing below us, witnessed the event; they quickly climbed to\nour position. Tyler called emergency services. Andy also saw the fall from a route just\nup-canyon and rappelled to the base of pitch five and then ascended a fixed line to reach\nme. The next hour or so was a bit of a blur for me. Bryce later recounted what happened:\n    \u201cWhile the position [the climber] was in was incredibly painful, Tyler and I initially\nmade the difficult decision not to move him, given the possible neck or spinal injury\nhe had sustained\u2026. [However], he and his wife both eventually decided that his posi-\ntion was unendurable, given the projected rescue ETA, and requested that we attempt\nsome sort of stabilization\u2026.\n    \u201cI attached several slings with a prusik to the climber\u2019s line and adjusted them to\nsupport his legs once horizontal. Using a double-length sling, we were able to secure\na makeshift chest harness around the climber and attach it to my line\u2026.. Once in\nposition, we instructed his wife to begin slowly lowering her husband to align his\nhips and shoulders, resting him horizontally across our knees. We slowly brought\nhis lower half down and rolled him facing upright, Andy supporting his neck while I\nworked to keep his back straight. While we did this, a helicopter appeared, hovered\nclose, then retreated. Tyler soon confirmed over the phone that a long-line hoist\nattempt would be made, and we were to keep the patient stable while a rescue crew-\nman secured him in a body sling.\n    \u201cAbout 15 minutes passed before the helicopter came into position over us and\nbegan lowering the crewman.

        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Assess Conditions, Inadequate Equipment\nSmugglers\u2019 Notch\nOn March 14, two instructors and four students of the Army Mountain Warfare School\nwere ascending Easy Gully, a wide snow gully that rises from near the high point of\nthe unplowed road through the notch, following a prominent landslide path. The\ngully rises at up to 40\u00b0. The Vermont Army National Guard team was participating in\na rough-terrain training exercise that the Army has conducted in this area for many\nyears. Easy Gully is also frequently used to approach several ice climbs above it.\n    At 1:05 p.m., as the team reached a point near fixed ropes the Army had installed\n near the start of the ice climb Grand Illusion, they triggered an avalanche. One team\nmember was able to \u201cswim\u201d off to the side. Two slid 500 feet along the gully. Three\nothers slid 1,000 feet and 50 feet vertically over a large rock. It is not known if any of\nthe team members were roped together at the time. No one was carrying avalanche\nbeacons, shovels, or probes.\n   Fortunately no one was completely buried and everyone was conscious. The team\nlocated everyone within 10 minutes. All were removed from the mountain within 1\nhour 40 minutes by Army personnel. Five injured persons were then transported by\nlocal emergency services to the University of Vermont Medical Center. Injuries were\nreported to include fractures, contusions, and abrasions.\n\nANALYSIS\nWhile there is no avalanche forecast for Smugglers\u2019 Notch, it would have been reason-\nable to assume the avalanche hazard was elevated. The snowpack\u2019s history was one of\nunseasonably warm weather followed by freezing, creating a sliding surface, and then\nseveral days of heavy snowfall. Two days prior to the Army incident, backcountry skiers\ntriggered a significant avalanche in a nearby Smugglers\u2019 Notch gully that was reported\non local television and in social media. On the day of the Army incident, the Smugglers\u2019\nNotch Resort ski area reported 23 inches of snow in the previous 24 hours. The local\nclimbing guidebook clearly states that many of the gullies in Smugglers\u2019 Notch, including\nspecifically Easy Gully by name, are common locations for both natural and climber-\ntriggered avalanches after recent snowfall. The specific site where the avalanche started\nis a natural collection point of snow coming off the cliffs above.\n    In follow-up investigations, the officers overseeing the training and the on-site\ninstructors acknowledged they were overconfident in their assessment of the avalanche\nrisk. Various faults in Army procedures\u2014and failure to follow procedures\u2014were noted.\nMore thorough and honest communication among the extended team might have\nprevented this incident. The team was also overconfident in its ability to mitigate the\nrisk. One day before the ascent, an instructor had attempted to reduce the avalanche\nrisk by \u201c\u2026 breaking the weak layer and knocking down snow from areas above Easy Gully\n                                                that have been known to trigger slides in\n                                                the past.\u201d It is doubtful that a small amount\n                                                of snow management could significantly\n                                                reduce such high avalanche risk.\n                                                    A cardinal rule of travel in avalanche-\n                                                prone terrain is to expose only one person\n                                                at a time to hazardous situations.

DP described himself as a novice climber; JC was the more\nexperienced of the two. DP was top-roping, with JC belaying from a wide ledge at the\nstart of the climb. DP trailed a second rope that was 50 meters long. When he reached\nthe top of the climb, he cleaned the anchor and threaded the trailing rope through\nthe rappel rings, and JC switched his belay from the lead rope to the trailing rope\nin preparation to lower DP. It was now dark; both climbers were using headlamps.\n    To attach himself to the trailing rope, DP tied a figure-8 on a bight somewhere\n near the middle of the rope and clipped this to his harness with a carabiner. This\nmeant there was about 25 meters of rope between DP and his belayer available for\nlowering. The climb is approximately 15 meters high, which meant there was not\nenough rope to lower DP all the way to the bottom of the route. The climbers had\nfailed to put a stopper knot at the end of the rope, so when the end reached JC, it\npassed through his belay device. DP fell to the ledge, then fell another three to five\nmeters to the ground. He suffered multiple injuries, including a spinal fracture.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe primary causes of the accident were the climber tying into the middle of the rope\ninstead of the end, which resulted in insufficient length to complete the lower-off,\nand the climbers failing to put a stopper knot in the other end of the rope to close\nthe system. Either action likely would have prevented the accident. It is unclear why\nDP trailed a rope to lower off instead of simply using the rope with which he was\ntop-roping. This decision added complexity to their rope management. In addition,\nfinishing in the dark and using headlamps is not ideal for situational awareness. The\nlate hour of the climb also may have led to a sense of urgency, resulting in some care-\nlessness. (Sources: Neil Van Dyke, Vermont Department of Public Safety and the Editors.)",

As we were setting up to climb\nan adjacent route, we watched two climbers rappel Melungian Brotherhood (5.8).\nPerson 1 (male, 17) rappelled using one doubled rope to an intermediate anchor, and\nthen set up another rappel with a second rope to reach the base. We wondered why\nthey hadn\u2019t just joined their ropes, but kept going about our business. Once they\nwere both at the base and had retrieved their ropes, Person 2 (male, 17) prepared to\nlead the route. We assumed that he would be belaying from the top, since neither of\ntheir ropes had been long enough to reach the ground when doubled.\n    We went around the corner to our next route, and some time later heard a series\nof crashes as if someone had dropped a backpack off the side of the mountain.

Further,\n Climber 1 should have equipped Climber 2 with the assisted-braking device in lieu of\nthe ATC. This might have prevented the uncontrolled fall and the burns to the belayer\u2019s\nhands. [Editor\u2019s note: If the belayer holds tight with the guide hand on the climber\u2019s strand\nof the rope in a fall, this can partially or fully defeat the effectiveness of assisted-braking\ndevices such as Grigris. Whatever device is used, the belayer must use the brake hand to\ncontrol a fall.] This situation also highlights the usefulness of belay gloves.\n    In the end, despite severe burns, Climber 2\u2019s ability to regain control of the belay\nprevented Climber 1 from a likely fatal impact with the ground.

Stuart, Cascadian Couloir\nAbout 11:50 a.m. on June 24, a climber called 911 to report that his partner (Varun\nSadavarte, 32) had fallen several hundred feet on Mt. Stuart and couldn\u2019t be reached.\nSadavarte and Owen Thomas (37) were friends who had taken a mountaineering\ncourse the year before and had climbed Mt. Baker and Mt. Adams. At 4 a.m. on June\n24, they left their campsite and started up the Cascadian Couloir, which has signifi-\ncant snow in early summer. They exited the couloir around 6:30 a.m. After ascending\nto the saddle between Stuart and Sherpa Peak, Sadavarte and Thomas hit the false\nsummit a few hundred feet below the top.\n    The route ahead was steeper than Thomas was expecting, so he decided to wait while\nSadavarte went to the summit. Sadavarte returned about 11 a.m. and said he was hungry\nand a little tired. He took a five- to ten-minute minute break for some food and water,\nand they started to discuss which way to descend. Sadavarte took three steps along the\nsnow slope below their rest spot, lost his balance, and began sliding on his stomach. He\nfumbled with his ice axe but was unable to slow down and quickly disappeared from sight.\nThomas called 911 after not being able to see or verbally contact his partner.\n    A climber below who had witnessed the slide yelled up to Thomas that he could\nsee Sadavarte and he appeared to be unresponsive. Another climber was able to climb\ndown to where Sadavarte had stopped. He also called 911 to report the accident and\nrelay his opinion that Sadavarte had not survived the fall.\n    By 2:40 p.m., a helicopter crew from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island was on\nscene and confirmed the climber was dead. They hoisted his body into the helicop-\nter at 3:25 p.m. and delivered it to a staging area before returning to the mountain\nto retrieve Thomas, who did not believe he could safely descend after witnessing his\npartner\u2019s fall. Searchers recovered Sadavarte\u2019s backpack and helmet, which sustained\nsignificant damage to the left side and front consistent with tumbling into a rocky\nbasin.

Fatigue also played a role. This is a long climb,\ngaining 4,600 feet from the campsite, and the climbers may have needed more time\nto rest and take in calories before descending a steep snow slope they\u2019d already\nidentified as potentially dangerous.

There were no photos on Mountain Project of the first pitch, so we weren\u2019t\nsure exactly where the route started. We scrambled up to a ledge below two crack\noptions. Alexis tried the left one first, but the awkward offwidth seemed hard to protect\nand more difficult than 5.7. She downclimbed to our belay ledge and moved over to a hand\nand fist crack on the right. This crack took better gear, but she found it similarly awkward.\n    When Alexis was about 10 feet up the crack, we decided we should look for other\noptions, perhaps further to the right. She started to downclimb again. When she was\nabout four feet above the starting ledge, she took out the first cam she had placed.\nThen she lost her balance or slipped, and she fell.\n    I tried to spot her with my left arm, but it was a futile effort. And we had made a\ncritical mistake: Since we were just starting the \u201cfirst pitch\u201d and were on a ledge, I\nhadn\u2019t anchored myself to belay. So, when she fell, we had zero protection and no\nanchor.

I worried\nabout a spinal injury, but in our precarious posi-\ntion, I decided she had to be moved\u2014help would\nbe hours away. Anchored to the tree and keeping\nher on belay, I was able to pull her upright, and\nwe moved together up to the ledge.\n   We used our Garmin inReach to signal for\nhelp.

Climber 3 (male, age 35) was\ntold by Climber 1 to clean the cam anchor before rappelling. He removed the cam\n and carabiners clipped to the top side of the cordelette anchor. As he rappelled, the\ncordelette slipped off the rock and Climber 3 fell to his death.\n\nANALYSIS\nTacoma Mountain Rescue and the National Park Service revisited the scene of the\naccident on August 25 and re-created the rappel anchors, based on photographs\ntaken by Climber 3 before the accident and recovered from his phone. An evalua-\ntion determined that the two carabiners connecting the cordelette to the prusik sling\nhad helped hold the cordelette in place. When the first two people to rappel loaded the\ncordelette with their weight, the carabiners essentially pinned the cordelette in place on\ntop of the block. Once these carabiners were removed, the cordelette was only held in\nplace by friction, which was insufficient to keep it from rolling and slipping off the rock.\n    As is often the case with alpine climbing accidents, this was the result of a series\nof decisions, any one of which might have prevented the accident. These include:\n    \u2022 Not using the peak\u2019s standard rappel anchor.\n    \u2022 Rappelling instead of downclimbing or lowering the student climbers.\n    \u2022 Choosing a block anchor without a sufficient lip or horn to hold the cord securely.\n    \u2022 Use of cord instead of slings to build the anchor (sling material would not be\n        as prone to rolling).\n    \u2022 Loosely slinging the cordelette rather than girth-hitching it around the block.\n    \u2022 Arranging the backup in such a way that the cordelette had to be lifted to clean\n        the carabiners, possibly making the cordelette less secure.\n    \u2022 Putting an inexperienced climber in the position of cleaning the backup, evalu-\n        ating if the cordelette anchor had been compromised by removing the cam and\n        carabiners, and rappelling without a backup.

The\ncaller informed Montopoli that he and his climbing partner had left the valley at about\n7 a.m. and reached the base of the southwest ridge route (5.7) at about noon, when\nthey ate all their food. They completed the climb and rappelled to the col at the top\nof the couloir at about 9 p.m. Although the reporting climber had an ice axe and was\nable to descend the steep, hard-packed snow in the couloir, his partner had left his\naxe at the base of the climb and was forced to downclimb exposed rock and scree to\nthe west of the snow. A short distance down from the col, the partner slipped and\nfell about 30 feet along a steep rock step. He then tumbled down rock and scree into\ntrees that prevented him from reaching the snow and falling further. He suffered a\nbroken right ankle and broken left fibula.\n     A two-member hasty team, followed by three additional rangers carrying heavier\nrescue and support gear, responded to the accident scene, located at an elevation of\nabout 10,200 feet. Steep, firm snow in Symmetry Couloir (the approach to the spire)\nnecessitated the use of ice axe and crampons for around 2,000 vertical feet. The hasty\nteam arrived at about 1 a.m. and provided medical attention, warm clothing, shelter,\nand food to the two climbers, who had not packed for spending the night outdoors.\nThe ambient air temperature was approximately 30\u00b0F. The second group of rescuers\narrived at about 2:40 a.m. and continued support for the two climbers. The following\nmorning, the two were extracted from the scene, one at a time, by helicopter short-\nhaul. (Source: National Park Service Search and Rescue Report.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThe two male climbers (both 18 years old) had inadequate inexperience for such a\nroute, and this showed in many ways: a relatively late start, a slow approach and a\nlong time spent on the route, inadequate food and gear for a big day (including no\nextra gear for an unexpected night out), and the fateful decision to leave one ice axe\nat the base of the climb, even though a snowy descent obviously was in store.

The climber appears to have only\nclipped one of the two strands of rappel rope when attaching his ATC. He was an\nexperienced climber and would not have committed this error out of ignorance. The\n partner\u2019s statement that she had just given him a puffy coat, which he subsequently\nput on, suggests that perhaps this coat concealed this error. It is likely that a bight of\nrope was pushed into the ATC but was not captured with the locking carabiner, yet\ngave the appearance of being properly clipped. Once he committed his body weight\nover the edge, the bight of rope would have instantly popped out of the ATC.\n    It may be in this moment that the subject uttered \u201cWhoops,\u201d as he would have\nexpected the autoblock backup that he had installed on both ropes to hold him.\nHowever, repeated tests during the investigation showed that an autoblock does not\nhold in this scenario. When only one of the strands of the rappel rope is correctly\ninserted into the device and clipped to the climber\u2019s harness, the climber\u2019s weight\non that strand will cause the other strand (not clipped correctly) to move upward,\ntoward the anchor. The autoblock will not hold when only one strand is through the\nrappel device and the two strands are moving in opposite directions.

Pack an ultralight waterproof tarp (such as a siltarp), extra\nlayers, and some extra food, get out of the wind, and huddle for warmth\u2014if a party\ncan stay dry and fed, the night may be miserable but it will not be life-threatening.\n    Mobile phones are increasingly useful tools for mountain navigation and commu-\nnication\u2014in certain areas\u2014but a cold night will rapidly drain a phone\u2019s battery. Keep\nthe phone warm (inside your clothing), resist the temptation to turn it on for non-\nessential reasons, and consider carrying an extra battery pack. Rewarming a \u201cdead\u201d\nphone can sometimes restore limited service. (Source: The Editors.)",

Their rappel rope had\nbecome stuck during their descent, after climbing the classic east ridge. The climb-\ners reported they had supplies to spend the night on the three-foot ledge they were\non, but would need assistance in the morning.\n    At first light on September 2, Tip Top Search and Rescue helicoptered to the area\nwith a short-haul team, and the crew dropped an additional rappel rope, a team radio,\nwater, and extra food to the climbers, as the stranded male was a Type 1 diabetic.\nThe two felt they were in good enough condition to self-evacuate with the supplies\ngiven. Tip Top\u2019s short-haul team landed in a nearby meadow to monitor the descent\nin case they needed further assistance.\n    Over the next couple of hours, the two became disoriented and struggled to\ncontinue. They had lost a bag with personal gear and medical supplies required for\nthe male\u2019s diabetes. His medical condition was beginning to worsen, and his climbing\npartner was able to communicate the change in status with the awaiting search and\nrescue team. The short-haul team rigged the helicopter, and despite high, swirling\nwinds on the cliff face, successfully brought both members off the mountain to the\nmeadow below. The helicopter subsequently flew all parties out of the mountains.\n(Source: Sublette County Sheriff\u2019s Office.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis is a good example of the \u201csnowball effect\u201d that can compound the seriousness\nof relatively small problems. It\u2019s not known when the party reached the summit, but\ndarkness and fatigue undoubtedly contributed to their stranding. Before attempting\nremote alpine routes, it\u2019s essential to acquire the skills and carry the equipment\nto recover a stuck rope, either by ascending the rope or by climbing back to the\nrappel anchor. Since they were unable to do either, they were forced to spend the\nnight at around 12,000 feet, which contributed to the need for a helicopter rescue\nin the morning.\n    Note that these climbers and at least one previous party on Wolf\u2019s Head were\n able to contact authorities in Pinedale by mobile phone. However, this should be\nconsidered a rare anomaly\u2014there is no reliable cell service in most parts of these\nmountains. (Source: The Editors.)",

The next thing you know you\u2019re sitting on your couch in a cast and writing\nan accident report for ANAC.\n    I work for the American Alpine Club, and we were on a staff outing to Vedauwoo\nin early June. For the second climb of the day, I suggested to my co-worker Craig\nthat we do a two-pitch 5.6 chimney called H&H Grunt, which would be nice and cool\ninside, while we waited for harder climbs to come into the shade. Craig led the first\npitch, and I took the lead for the second pitch, burrowing through a vertical tunnel.\nIt was fun and well protected until I pulled onto a ledge where I was faced with about\n15 feet of unprotected face and crystal climbing to get to a bolted anchor.\n    I could tell I was no longer on what I considered to be 5.6 terrain, but Vedauwoo\nis known for sandbags and runouts. I downclimbed to see if I had missed something,\nbut every option looked more difficult. Back on the ledge, I looked down at my last\npiece of protection. It was a bomber number 4 cam, but the piece was below my feet,\nplus I had put a long sling on it to avoid rope drag. About six feet below that piece was\nanother ledge. I yelled down to Craig, \u201cThis looks like a bad place to fall!\u201d\n    I felt confident I could make what looked to be a few 5.9 moves and then scurry\nto the top on easier ground. I stepped gingerly onto a couple of crystals, and almost\nimmediately a foothold popped off. When I hit the ledge I could feel pain shoot\nthrough my right ankle. My gear had not absorbed any of the impact, although it kept\nme from rolling off the lower ledge. I caught my breath and took inventory: no heavy\nbleeding, no bones sticking out of my skin. Craig gently lowered me to the ground, and\nwith some scooching on my butt and limping with my arms on my friends\u2019 shoulders,\nI was able to get to the car. A two-hour ride home got me to my couch.\n     After receiving X-rays and limping around on a supposed sprained ankle for four\nweeks, the doctor ordered an MRI and a date with an orthopedic surgeon, who said\nI actually had a talus fracture in my right ankle and needed surgery.\n\nANALYSIS\nI had done the 5.6 route a few years earlier and thought I remembered using the\nbolted anchor above the blank slab. After the accident I reviewed the guidebook: It\nsays to follow the chimney to a notch and then traverse right to a different set of\nanchors. Two co-workers who finished the route the way I tried to go to retrieve our\ngear said it was at least 5.9. I had been very set on where I thought the route went,\nand I felt I could do the moves, so I ignored some obvious warning signs.\n    When I was standing on the top ledge I noticed a crack at my feet. Gear placed\nhere still would have been below my feet when I fell, but that extra piece would have\nshortened my fall by about three feet. If you are facing a dangerous runout, place the\nhighest gear you can. (Source: Carol Kotchek.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Poor Position, Weather\nBritish Columbia, Mt. Robson Provincial Park, Whitehorn Mountain\nIn the early hours of April 23, a party of two climbers from Europe left their high camp,\nlocated in the northeast bowl of Whitehorn Mountain (3,399 meters), to attempt\nthe northeast face of the mountain. This is not believed to be an established route.\n    The party roped up for three pitches of waterfall ice interspersed with broad\nsnow ledges. As the leader was approaching the top of the third ice pitch, they were\nstruck by an avalanche. From the description and site inspection, it is suspected this\nwas a solar-triggered soft slab avalanche of size 1.5 (on the Canadian scale that runs\nto size 5). The party reported that small avalanches had been coming down as soon\n as the sun started to shine on the\nface above them, and that they\nhad nearly made it to the relative\nsafety of the left side of the snow\nledge when they were struck by\nthe larger slide.\n    The party was swept down\nthe climb and ended up in the\nmiddle of the run-out zone (2,400\nmeters).

Robson Valley SAR requested the assistance of Parks Canada\nVisitor Safety staff, who conducted the rescue.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe northeast face of Whitehorn Mountain was still holding winter snowpack at\nthe time of this incident. As a result the route was exposed to a significant objec-\ntive hazard from the large snow slope and cornice running the length of the ridge\nabove the route. Despite the party getting an early start, the snow slope and the\ncorniced ridge were catching the early morning sun. This was also the start of the\nfirst significant warming trend of the season. The party reported that they had not\nbeen able to see the significant avalanche terrain above the roped pitches from the\nbase of the route. These climbers were not equipped with avalanche rescue gear\n(transceiver, probes, and shovels) and were fortunate that they ended up on the\nsurface of the snow.\n    While the climbers did have a means of calling for help (which likely saved their\nlives), they did not have the phone numbers of the local response agencies. This\ndelayed the response time. Had this incident occurred a few hours later in the day,\nthe communication delay may have forced the seriously injured climbers to spend\na night on the mountain.",

Why the PLB\ncoordinates were inaccurate is unclear. It is possible the device was being switched\non and off and thus did not obtain and send more accurate coordinates, or the party\u2019s\nlocation on the mountain may have been suboptimal for the PLB to communicate\nwith satellites.

Bob O\u2019Rourke They did not require surgery.\n ANALYSIS\nWaterfall ice is a dynamic medium, and climbing it safely requires experience, skill,\nand attention to changing conditions. The danger can be minimized, but there will\nalways be a certain level of risk accepted by waterfall ice climbers. The injured climber\nwrote an in-depth analysis of the decision-making factors influencing this incident:\n   (1) Fatigue. He had a poor sleep the night before and an early morning start. It\n       was the end of a long trip, and he was going home in a few days, so his mind\n       was on other things.\n   (2) Familiarity. He had climbed Ice Nine a few times earlier that season, and it was\n       in good shape. He felt it would be a relatively easy day.\n   (3) Peer pressure. Some friends had come up right behind them. The injured\n       climber didn\u2019t feel overly pressured but stated that he likely rushed more\n       than normal.\n   (4) Not adapting to changing conditions. The climb had freshly formed chandelier\n       ice on the surface. The leader had already downclimbed the first five meters\n       once, due to the conditions, and was checking out a new line when he fell. In\n       his words: \u201cAbout ten to 15 [feet] off the ground I started to slow down and\n       consider my options again. I didn\u2019t like it, but it did look okay higher up. As I\n       was pondering my options, one of my tools sheared and I pitched. It was too\n       low to have gear in, and the ice was horrible anyway. My mistake was not in\n       the protection system but rather my inability to slow down and climb more\n       carefully. Conditions had changed rapidly.\u201d\n\nFrom a rescuer\u2019s perspective, this party did many things that made the rescue quick\nand safe:\n   (1) The party had a VHF radio programmed with the Parks Canada frequencies\n       so they could talk directly to emergency dispatchers. This allowed the rescue\n       specialists to accurately gauge the severity of the situation, determine what\n       resources would be required, and pass instructions to the injured climbers.\n       Parks Canada encourages backcountry users who will be out of cell range to\n       carry a properly programmed VHF radio, a satellite phone, or two-way satel-\n       lite texting devices for emergency communications.\n   (2) The party had started early and had their accident early in the day. This allowed\n       rescuers to perform the rescue before avalanche danger rose in the afternoon.\n   (3) The party moved the injured climber to a spot with decreased overhead danger\n       from ice daggers, and they chopped out a platform to help with immobiliza-\n       tion. This sped up the patient packaging once rescuers arrived.\n\n\n",

        "Details_Factors": "Rope Cut\nAlberta, Bow Valley, Yamnuska\nOn July 29, a party of two experienced climbers was climbing Chockstone Corner\non Yamnuska\u2019s big limestone face. It is a nine-pitch climb (5.8) requiring traditional\nprotection. The leader had started up pitch seven, about 60 meters below the top of\nthe face. He clipped a fixed piton and placed one additional piece. After struggling\nwith a difficult passage he fell, and the belayer watched as the climber fell past him\nand toward the ground far below. The belayer never felt the force of the fall on his\nbelay device, suggesting the rope was somehow cut in the early stages of the fall.\nAfterward, the belayer could see the frayed end of the cut rope above him, looped\nover a bulge just past the fixed piton.\n   The belayer was stranded at the belay and called 911 with a cell phone. Rescue\ncrews flew to the scene and confirmed the fatality. Crews then were flown to the\ntop of the cliff. They lowered a rescuer to the stranded climber, and the rescuer and\nclimber descended to the ground in a continuous 250-meter lower. They were then\nheli-slung to the staging area below.\n\nANALYSIS\nA rope under tension can cut quite easily if it slides over a sharp or rough edge or is\nhit by rockfall. Yet climbing ropes very rarely fail in leader falls. What was different\nthis time?\n    These climbers were experienced and certainly capable of climbing their chosen\nroute. As with many routes on Yamnuska, Chockstone Corner involves lots of travers-\ning. In an interview with Gripped magazine some time after the accident, the belayer\nsaid the leader appeared to get off-route soon after leaving the belay ledge to start\nthe seventh pitch. \u201cHe had followed a good groove leading to a piton above the belay\ninstead of the obvious crack on the right. He continued up right on a less-than-\nfeatured wall, aiming for easier ground above instead of going direct into the wide\nchimney. \u2026 At the time of the accident, the climbing was on good rock, traversing\nrightward across a ledge with what looked to be large boulders or blocks.\u201d\n    Above this ledge, the leader placed a number 2 cam, began to move again, and\nthen returned to the cam to extend a sling to reduce rope drag. It was later learned\nthat this cam pulled out during the fall (it was found on the ground). The belayer\nbelieves the leader was no more than five meters past the cam when he fell. On this\ntraversing pitch, the leader\u2019s fall must have dragged the rope in such a way\u2014perhaps\n around or over the blocks above the ledge\u2014that the rope was cut before any load\ncame onto the belayer. It\u2019s likely that when the cam pulled out, this contributed to\nthe length and possibly the swinging nature of the fall.\n   The climbers were using a single \u201clike new\u201d 9.2mm rope. It is possible\u2014but by no\nmeans certain\u2014that a larger-diameter rope might have survived the fall. Leading\nwith two half-ropes might have been a better choice, because it\u2019s unlikely that both\nropes would have impacted whatever piece of rock cut the single rope, in exactly\nthe same way, particularly if they were clipped to alternating pieces of protection, as\nhalf-ropes are supposed to be used. It\u2019s also important to consider how to keep the\nrope running as straight as possible\u2014and away from edges, blocks, or notches\u2014using\nprotection, extension, and occasional backcleaning, as necessary.

        "Details_Factors": "Off-Route on Descent\nAlberta, Waterton Lakes National Park, Sofa Mountain\nTwo Southern Alberta Alpine Club of Canada members climbed the snow gully route\non Sofa Mountain\u2019s east face on March 13. They arrived at the summit at 3:47 p.m. and\nrested there, taking advantage of the warm, stable weather before descending.\n    At 4 p.m. they started to descend the summit ridge with the intention of traveling\nthe normal descent route, the northeast shoulder to the summer trail. Upon leav-\ning the summit ridge, they began scrambling down the upper cliff band on the north\nface. Once down, both members descended the fall line, where they began to veer\noff course from the normal descent route.\n    The two scrambled down 175 meters before reaching the first of a series of ledges\non the lower cliff band. At this point they decided to follow the upper ledge west,\nthinking it would lead them to an easier passage to the basin below. After 150 meters\nthey reached a steep chimney feature that was flowing with meltwater from the\nsnowy slopes above. They decided to rappel to the lower ledge to circumvent the\nchimney and the water-filled channel, then continued scrambling down several ledges\nbefore reaching another dead end, approximately 20 meters above talus slopes.\n    With the end of their descent in sight, and with low energy levels after a long,\nstrenuous day, team dynamics started to deteriorate as the crew split up to investi-\ngate different options. The trip leader remained on the ledge to seek a suitable rappel\nanchor while his partner looked for a downclimb. Eventually the partner found a steep\nramp that appeared to lead to lower ledges. She shouted to inform the trip leader\nabout her plan and began scrambling down before confirming if the leader had heard\nher. Suddenly she heard a loud scream from the leader, who had begun rappelling.\nShe saw the leader fall about 10 meters from the upper ledge, land on the lower ledge,\nthen roll off and fall another six meters to the talus; he then cartwheeled 70 or 80\nmeters down that steep slope. The partner climbed down to the leader, who at first\nappeared to be unresponsive and not breathing. Shortly after she reached him, he\nregained consciousness. At this point she called 911 using her cell phone.\n    A rescue team was deployed at 6:55 p.m., ten minutes after the accident occurred.\nAt approximately 8:30 p.m., a medical helicopter arrived on scene, followed shortly\nthereafter by a rescue helicopter. Parks Canada safety technicians were dropped off\nby the rescue helicopter at the bottom of the basin and they hiked up to the climb-\ners. After first aid, the patient was immobilized in a boost bag and slung down to\n the air ambulance waiting in the\nbasin. The leader sustained four\nfractured vertebrae, other frac-\ntures, and multiple lacerations\nand contusions to his head and\nlegs. He was expected to make a\nfull recovery.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climber had no recollection\nof the fall or the events lead-\ning up to the accident, so the\nexact cause of the accident will\nremain uncertain.

Parks Canada\ndressed. It is assumed that the\nsubject slung the cordelette around a boulder or piece of bedrock, and that the\ncordelette rolled off the anchor or the anchor rock shifted or became dislodged. The\nleader believes he might have slipped or stumbled as he started his rappel, which\nmay have added force to the anchor.\n    The leader\u2019s fall easily could have been fatal.

Fortunately, the group was in an area with cell service,\nwhich resulted in an immediate response from rescue services in Waterton and the\nsurrounding area.

        "Details_Factors": "Poor Protection\nOntario, Orient Bay\nI was ice climbing with two partners in the Orient Bay corridor near Nipigon over\na long weekend in March. My accident occurred on the second \u201cpitch\u201d on what\nappears to be an unnamed mixed dihedral to the right of the Right Stuff in the Amy\nR area. One partner led a short ice ramp up to a fairly large ledge. We switched leads\nand I started up the somewhat chossy dihedral. I placed two cams down low and off\nto the side (maybe four to six feet above the belay) to keep me from falling all the\nway to the ground should something happen. The first real protection possibility\non the route appeared to be a horizontal crack about 15 feet up. I never made it.\nI found a (seemingly) solid right tool placement in a crack and then tested a left hand-\n                                   hold at about the same elevation.

It was our fourth visit to this crazy place, and we had\nour eyes on a 15-pitch climb called Devotion (5.11), which is notorious for being a bit\nrun-out, hard for the grade, and chossy. We very well might have been the only people\nto attempt it since we\u2019d bailed on the 10th pitch about a year earlier.\n    We climbed with the leader using two single ropes, being belayed on only one\nrope but clipping both to the bolts to avoid confusion, since the ropes looked very\nsimilar. Cruising and climbing at a steady pace, we passed the lower crux and made\n it to the 3rd-class seventh pitch. We had experienced some rope drag on the way up\ndue to the system we were using, but it didn\u2019t seem too bad.\n    At this point I tried to link pitches eight (5.11a) and nine (5.11c), as had been recom-\nmended. So far, I hadn\u2019t taken a fall. After the first few bolts, I found myself climb-\ning a really thin and technical slab\u2014way too difficult for 5.11a\u2014and inevitably I fell.\nI quickly realized the correct beta was to climb through a dirty, cactus-filled crack\nsystem about five feet to the right of the bolt line. I finished up pitch eight and was\na couple of bolts up on pitch nine when I ran into the same problem, on an impos-\nsible slab, except this time I had a crazy amount of rope drag. There was a dihedral\nwith plenty of holds around a corner and about five feet to the right of the bolt line.\nI wasn\u2019t stoked to climb with my ropes around a sharp corner, and to be extra safe, I\nasked my partners to belay me with both ropes.\n    Two bolts higher, I took a fall. It was a clean fall, and everything felt fine. I started\nto climb back up the dihedral and grabbed a hold that looked very solid but turned\nout to be part of a loose boulder that was the size of a small car. It immediately went\nflying down the wall. I didn\u2019t weight it, kick it, or even tug on it. It was so loose that it\nprobably would have fallen in the next rainfall. I yelled \u201cROCK, ROCK, ROCK!\u201d as loud\nas I ever had and watched in horror as this death block approached my best friends.\nLuckily, the rock bounced off the wall and crashed into the 3rd-class terrain about\na foot behind my friends. I started to panic, hyperventilating and tearing up. I had\nbeen certain my friends were going to die.\n    We all were yelling back and forth, and in between some of my deep breaths\nI heard, \u201cWe\u2019re OK\u201d and \u201cGo in direct!\u201d I was trying to calm myself down, but all I\nwanted was to not be on the rock. I start to downclimb to the previous bolt, and\nwhen I was level with it, I loosely grabbed the quickdraw, swung out, and yelled for a\n\u201ctake,\u201d assuming I was on belay. In my panic, I never thought about the possibility of\nthe boulder cutting the ropes, a tragic error. I started to plummet.\n    I was yelling for my life. I knew I was dead. I fell for a little while, struck a ledge,\nand continued to fall until I smashed into a small tree and some cactus on the\n3rd-class ledges a few feet from my friends, having fallen or slid 35 to 40 meters. I\nwas conscious for every bit of the fall, even the landing. I didn\u2019t know what to think.\nI was glad I survived the fall, but assumed I wasn\u2019t feeling anything because I was in\nshock, and that I was probably bleeding internally or and had terrible fractures. A\nfew minutes passed, and I felt like I was semi-okay. So, with the help of my friends, I\nstood up. We began calling everyone we thought might help. I ended up being flown\noff by a helicopter that hovered over the ledge and lowered a line with a harness\nattached. My partners then rappelled the route.\n    I was in the hospital for four nights and walked out on my own two feet, with only\ntwo small fractures (one on the back of my skull, where my head hit the rock below\nmy helmet, and also a rib), some abrasions, and bruises. I should be dead, but I\u2019m not.\n\nANALYSIS\nLooking back, I should have tried to calm down more after the rockfall and before I\ntried to move. I obviously wasn\u2019t thinking clearly, and if I\u2019d slowed down I might have\nheard my partners say the ropes had been cut or I might have checked myself. It\u2019s\nhard to calm down in panic situations. (Source: Foster Denney.)\n",

The party arrived in\nthe early evening of June 26 by helicopter, set up base camp, and prepared for an\nalpine start the next morning.\n   All three had previous experience in the Mendenhall Towers. Two of the three\nhad previously climbed Main Tower, by different routes, and Climbers 1 and 2 had\nattempted the southeast ridge of the Main Tower in September 2018. This attempt\n was stopped short after about 1,000 feet of climbing when a loose rock caused a\nlaceration on Climber 2\u2019s pinkie finger that resulted in stitches.\n    In 2019, the party of three left base camp at 6:30 a.m. and, after a long day of swap-\nping leads, they summited around 10:30 p.m. In high spirits they enjoyed the sunset\nover the Juneau Icefield and began their descent around 11 p.m.\n    The climbers descended via the ascent route. The nature of the southeast ridge\nmade for numerous short rappels. Old tat, wires, and slung horns were found\nthroughout the descent and used as rappel anchors. The climbers added or replaced\nthese anchors when needed; however, they did not back up the anchors with remov-\nable protection while the first and second climber were rappelling. Climber 1 led the\nrappels throughout the night because he had previous experience with the descent.\n    After eight to ten rappels (about 1,000 feet), they arrived on a spacious 15- by\n20-foot ledge at 1:30 a.m. Each climber was fatigued, dehydrated, and lacking nutri-\ntion. However, with base camp now in view, they were motivated to keep going.\n    The rappel anchor at the large ledge was one bomber\nlarge hex and one medium wire, poorly equalized with a\ncord and a quick-link at the masterpoint. A visual inspection\nrevealed that one end of the cord was frayed and without\nmuch space between the knot and the fraying end; Climber\n1 also noted the anchor cord was the same as he had seen on\nthis anchor the year prior. After a short discussion, the climb-\ners concluded the anchor was good enough. The party began\nrappelling without replacing the cord or backing up the anchor.\n    Climber 1 started down, and in an effort to save time\nhe bypassed the next spacious ledge, about 40 feet below,\nand continued down the ridge on rappel to a small ledge,\ndescending a total of about 100 feet. He found a suitable\nhorn to sling and went off rappel. Climber 2 rigged his rappel\ndevice, walked from the anchor to the lip of the ledge (15\nfeet), weighted the rope, and instantly the anchor failed.\nClimber 2 fell to the next ledge 40 feet below, taking the\nrappel rope with him in his fall. Climber 1, down below, did\nnot witness the fall, only heard a very loud thud. Climber 3\nwitnessed the anchor failure: Both pieces of rock protection\nwere still in the wall, but the cord that had connected the\npieces was at his feet.\n    Climber 3, perched on the ledge above, was able to see\nand hear Climber 2 after the fall. He was lying on his side and\nnot responsive, only moaning. Immediately, Climber 3 called\n911 and informed dispatch of the severity of the accident and\nthe need for a helicopter; this phone call took place around\n1:45 a.m. Climber 1 and Climber 3 both carried cell phones,\nand Climber 1 was able to use GPS services from the phone\nSoutheast buttress of Main Tower in the Mendenhall Towers.

A Coast Guard helicopter was\ndispatched from Sitka shortly after 2:30 a.m. with an ETA of one and half hours to\nJuneau, followed by a short flight to the Mendenhall Towers.\n    The accident had left Climber 3 without a rope or gear to descend to Climber\n2\u2019s position 40 feet below. Climber 1 was about 70 feet lower and held the ends of\nthe rappel rope, but since the rope was no longer anchored, he could not ascend\nit. As they waited for help, Climber 3 continued to monitor Climber 2 from above,\nand around 3:30 a.m., in the first light of the morning, he was able to communicate\ndirectly with Climber 1. He relayed that Climber 2 was not moving and that blood had\nflowed from the back of his head. Climber 1 decided to climb up to Climber 2, whom\nhe reached around 4 a.m. He noticed minor sounds of moaning and a light pulse from\nclimber 2\u2019s radial artery.\n    Shortly before 4:12 a.m., the Coast Guard helicopter arrived. The climbers used the\nred flashing mode on their headlamps to signal the helicopter. (A crew member later\nsaid the red flashes were very helpful in pinpointing their location on the large, dark\nwall.) Climber 1 prepared Climber 2 for the helicopter by cutting his rappel device\nfrom the rope and untangling the rope. Climber 1 noticed the quick-link from the\nfailed rappel anchor was still connected to the rope. At 4:30 a.m., the Coast Guard\nrescuers efficiently plucked Climber 2 off the mountain and flew him to Bartlett\nRegional Hospital in Juneau.\n    Back on the wall, Climber 1 was able to throw some gear up to Climber 3 so he\ncould rig a rappel. Both climbers then rappelled safely down the rest of the route and\nreturned to their base camp at 8 a.m. They flew back to town by helicopter, arriving at\n10 a.m., and joined Climber 2 at the hospital. Sadly, the injuries the climber sustained\nwere not survivable, and he died at 11:27 a.m. on June 28.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe party\u2019s decision not to replace the old tat on the rappel anchor proved to be a\nfatal mistake. This decision was made in a very fatigued state, and the climbers\u2019 judg-\nments were impaired. They prioritized getting back to base camp quickly over taking\nextra time to ensure the safety of their anchors. This seems like a very misguided\nerror, but in the early hours of the morning, running on little sleep, dehydrated and\nhungry, you may make odd decisions you would not otherwise.\n    In addition to replacing or supplementing the old tat on the anchor, the climb-\ners could have backed up each of their anchors while the first two climbers were\nrappelling. The third and lightest person to rappel could have removed the backups\nbefore starting down.\n    Complacency in the face of risk led the climbers to decide the rappel anchor was\ngood enough. These climbers were young and had had an abundance of positive expe-\nriences in climbing. They had completed more then half of the rappels already. They\nlet their guard down too early.

The rappel anchor was on the far east end of the summit, out of range\nof the small tree we used for an anchor at the top of our climb. I unclipped from our\n                         anchor, grabbed the two ends of the rope, and started moving\n                        across the summit toward the rap anchor.

Either his\n                        momentum was too great or the ledge he anticipated landing on\n                        didn\u2019t exist because, with a scream that I will never forget, he fell\n                        30 feet, out of my sight. I took the phone from my pocket to dial\n                        911. I remained on the line with dispatch for a total of 46 minutes. I\n                        consciously made the decision to stay at the top after calling 911,\nSite of the fall at\nthe top of Chimney because I believed it was most important for me to have a view of\nR o c k . S t e p h e n the road and direct responders to Chris\u2019 position. I am an engineer\nWhittingham             and don\u2019t have any experience related to emergency medicine.\n                        From one vantage point, I could see Chris at the base of the rock,\nand at first he appeared to be unconscious but soon began to stir.\n    As an ambulance came up the mountain, I took a couple of bright climbing slings\noff my shoulder and began waving them around my head. When the ambulance got\ncloser, the driver honked, signaling that he saw me. A sheriff\u2019s deputy arrived, and I\ntried to yell down the best way for someone to reach Chris\u2019 location.\n    Sometime after noon, I could hear the unmistakable chop of an approaching heli-\ncopter. Again, I took the climbing slings from my chest and swung them around my\nhead to capture the pilot\u2019s attention, then pointed to the side of the rock where Chris\nwas lying. Soon after, a rescuer was being lowered to the ground. I now made my way\nover to the rappel station and flaked out my rope for a rappel. Back on the ground,\nI assisted in placing a neck brace and positioning Chris on a backboard. The deputy\nmaneuvered him into a hoist bag. In mere seconds, Chris was at the helicopter and\nwas flown down the mountain to an awaiting ambulance. I remember looking down\nat my watch and the time was 12:43 p.m., about two hours after the accident.\n    As told by Chris: I had a concussion and a number of broken bones in my face\nbut did not have any head bleed or skull fracture. Somehow, both my nose and jaw\nescaped unharmed, although my lip and left ear had some pretty severe lacerations,\nand two bones in my right ankle were broken.

Although it was not\npossible to reach the rappel anchor from the anchor I built off the small tree, I could\nhave made the decision to extend it with one or two of the many slings I had with me.\nLarge ledges or summits may provide a false sense of security, and I hope this write-\nup encourages readers to stay on anchor or build a new anchor while maneuvering\nacross an uneven ledge with potentially deadly exposure. [Editor\u2019s Note: Another good\noption is to maintain a belay while each climber makes the transition between anchors.]\n    Another lesson I learned from this is the importance of having a means to call\nfor a rescue.

        "Incident_Type": "MT. SHASTA ANNUAL SUMMARY- 2019",
        "Details_Factors": " CALIFORNIA\n\nMt. Shasta and Castle Crags Wilderness\nIn 2019 there were 16 climbing-related incidents on Mt. Shasta. Twelve accidents\nwere due to falls on ice or snow, and four climbers attempting the summit became\nlost. This is the second year of above-average rescues on Mt. Shasta, and one accident\nresulted in a fatality.\n    On May 11, a 53-year-old male climber who had separated from his party fell at the\nHeart (12,300 feet), was unable to self-arrest, and tumbled approximately 1,000 feet.\nHis fall was slowed and eventually stopped by two climbers who \u201cjumped on him\u201d as\nhe slid in the Upper Moraine. He suffered facial trauma, a left shoulder/arm injury,\nand a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Other climbers built a platform and secured the\npatient to the slope with an ice axe anchor. As responders prepared the patient for\nevacuation, two of the climbers moved upslope with their shovels to deflect falling\nrime ice, which was greater than normal and a real objective hazard. The climber\nwas evacuated by helicopter.\n    On June 2, a female climber, age 23, slipped while skinning toward Helen Lake,\nfalling approximately 500 feet. Mt. Shasta climbing rangers responded to the injured\nclimber and conducted a patient assessment that revealed a femur fracture. They\nconstructed a snow platform and attempted to apply a makeshift traction device\nuntil a California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter arrived to evacuate the injured\nclimber. On June 8, a male, age 39, fell while skiing in Avalanche Gulch and slid 600\nfeet, suffering probable broken ribs. He too was evacuated by helicopter. Both skiers\u2019\nfalls happened on days when the snow was very smooth and icy.\n    On June 9, three separate accidents occurred on Shasta. The first, at 5:50 a.m.,\nhappened when a 60-year-old male slipped in Avalanche Gulch and fell headfirst\nfor 800 feet until stopped by two climbers. The climber was unconscious for five\nminutes and suffered a TBI and facial trauma. Later in the morning, a climber slipped\nand fell on the west face route. Little is known about how this accident occurred,\nbut the climber suffered minor abrasions and an unknown leg injury. The final acci-\ndent of the day occurred in Avalanche Gulch at 1 p.m. when a 49-year-old male fell\nwhile descending and suffered abrasions and lacerations to his lower back, lower\nchest, and arms.\n    On June 14, a male climber, age 76, slipped and fell on the Avalanche Gulch route.\nThe accident occurred when the climber saw one of his partner\u2019s crampons come\nloose and attempted to stop the crampon from sliding down the hill. The climber lost\nhis ice axe and slid 300 feet before hitting a large ice block. He suffered a fractured\nthumb, a minor neck fracture, rib fracture, and large leg contusion. The climber was\nhoisted and evacuated by helicopter.\n    On August 14, two climbers summited Mt. Shasta via the Clear Creek Route.\nThis was the conclusion of an extended hiking trip that began in Ashland, Oregon,\nand traversed seven wilderness areas. Reaching the summit late in the day, the\n                                                      pair decided to bivy near the top. The\n                                                     next morning the party mistakenly\n                                                     descended the Whitney Glacier rather\n                                                     than their intended route down the\n                                                     west face. They did not have ice axes,\n                                                     crampons, helmets, or other moun-\n                                                     taineering gear\u2014only running shoes\n                                                     with short gaiters for footwear. The\n                                                     two decided they would try to glissade\n                                                     down the head of the Whitney Glacier.\n                                                     The two began their glissade together,\nThe Whitney Glacier on the north side of Mt. Shasta. with the female climber hugging her\nThe circle marks the crevasse that two under-\nequipped climbers/hikers slid into during an\n                                                     boyfriend from behind. They quickly\nattempted glissade. Nick Meyers | USFS               lost control, sliding directly into a berg-\n                                                     schrund at approximately 13,000 feet.\n    The male climber landed face-first on the downhill side of the bergschrund,\nbreaking his sunglasses on the firm snow and ice, but was otherwise uninjured. The\nfemale climber landed directly on top of him and then fell back into the bergschrund,\nlanding about 25 feet down. Fortunately, she was able to catch herself on a small ice\nshelf but was unable to climb out. Miraculously, good cell service inside the crevasse\nallowed a 911 call. Siskiyou County SAR and USFS rangers responded immediately\nand inserted ranger Nick Meyers to the scene. He constructed a snow anchor and\nlowered a rope to the injured climber. After conducting a quick verbal assessment of\nher injuries and instructing her on how to secure herself to the rope, ranger Meyers\nand the boyfriend manually hoisted her to the surface as she stemmed up the sides of\nthe crevasse. The injured climber was evacuated by helicopter hoist; she had suffered\nminor cuts and bruises, and was very cold and humbled.\n    The very next day, August 15, a 30-year-old male climber fell while attempting\na one-day climb of the Avalanche Gulch route. He and his partner were equipped\nwith lightweight distance-running-style backpacks, Gore-tex running shoes, micro-\nspikes instead of crampons, and ice axes. The team got off route above Helen Lake,\nmoving right onto the flank of Sargents Ridge, a steep snow slope known locally\nas the Alaska Chute. About halfway up, the climber attempted to adjust his micro-\nspikes as they were beginning to come off. He slipped while doing so and fell several\nhundred feet, hitting a rock and severely injuring his right ankle. Rangers lowered\nthe patient by SKED to the upper moraine above Helen Lake, from which he was\nevacuated by helicopter.\n    The final accident of the 2019 climbing season on Mt. Shasta, on August 31,\nresulted in a fatality when a 27-year-old male slipped and fell while descending in\nAvalanche Gulch. The climber was a member of a larger party that was off-route\n(far climber\u2019s left) on the slope of Casaval Ridge. An older member of the team had\nslipped, injuring his leg and face, and the team had decided to descend rather than\ncontinue up the mountain. They prepared to use a rope to lower the injured climber.\nAt this point, the 27-year-old decided to descend by himself without using the rope.\nWhat exactly occurred at this point is unknown, as the fall was unobserved, but the\nteam later found the climber unconscious, with head injuries and facial trauma. A\n local paramedic and flight crew member who was climbing at the time, Scott Half-\nerman, came to the immediate aid of the climber, along with rangers and members\nof the CHP helicopter crew. Unfortunately, the climber succumbed to his injuries\non September 2.\n\nANALYSIS\nSearch and rescue incidents on Mt. Shasta were elevated for the second year in a row,\neven as the number of summit passes remained only slightly above the yearly average\nof passes since 1997. Winter and spring storms resulted in heavy snowpack on the\nmountain, but late storms (into May) did little to discourage climbers. As in previous\nyears, falls on steep snow and failure to self-arrest were the primary cause for injury.\n    Rangers at Mt. Shasta continually focus their education efforts on the impor-\ntance of self-arrest, navigation in mountainous terrain, proper preparation (skills,\nability, and equipment), and how to plan for self-rescue. These skills and having situ-\national awareness are keys to a successful summit and descent. (Source: Mt.

This climb is\npopular for new leaders due to the grade, but the rock quality is considered low for\nthe area. The leader fell at approximately 25 feet above a large ledge. An unknown\nnumber of pieces blew, causing him to hit the ledge, bounce, and continue falling for\nanother ten feet before being stopped by his belayer. The climber, who was severely\ninjured, was unable to climb back to the belay, so the belayer tied off his injured\npartner and called for assistance.\n    Members of Truckee Tahoe Regional Rescue Team responded to the top of the\nwall and lowered a rescuer with a Stokes basket, secured the injured climber, and\nassisted the party to the bottom of the cliff. The leader suffered numerous traumatic\ninjuries, including a fractured pelvis, fractured back, and a head injury. He was wear-\ning a helmet.

Many new\ntrad leaders are drawn to its low grade and easy appearance, but the rock quality of\nthis climb is poor and a number of accidents have occurred here over the years. [A\nsecond accident occurred on this climb on August 16 when a leader (male, age unknown)\nfell after getting his foot stuck in the crack.

He fell about ten feet, landing awkwardly onto his pad. He was\nclimbing with friends but had no spotter at the time. Upon landing, he sustained\na severe open fracture ankle dislocation. Two friends came to his assistance and\ncontacted El Dorado Search and Rescue.

Fortunately, the friends who\nwere bouldering nearby were able to contact search and rescue, and air evacuation\nwas completed just prior to sunset. Due to the nature of the fracture, any additional\ndelay could have significantly affected the prospects for recovery. The climber\nbelieves this accident would have been prevented if he\u2019d had a spotter to guide his\nlanding. No matter how easy a problem is, it\u2019s always best to have spotters. (Source:\nCarolina Rodr\u00edguez, friend of the injured climber.)\n\nA NOTE ON BOULDERING ACCIDENTS: This bouldering incident was unusual because\nit led to a rescue involving a helicopter and other significant resources. Accidents in\nNorth American Climbing reports few bouldering incidents, but not because they are\nrare\u2014we see anecdotal reports about numerous injuries, usually involving the lower\nlegs. However, most boulderers who get hurt rely on their friends and other climbers to\nself-rescue and get medical attention, and thus the accidents are never reported offi-\ncially.

Dan Z.\ndifficulty of the descent and hike out, which\nincludes third-class terrain, Dan and Jon decided to use the device to call for a rescue.\n    The group decided to lower Dan and Jon with both parties\u2019 ropes tied together.\nUsing a Munter hitch, they first lowered Dan, then pulled the rope back up to lower\nJon. They then untied the ropes and tossed Dan and Jon\u2019s rope back to them. Though\nthe second party initially intended to keep climbing, they eventually decided to rappel,\nand they helped Dan and Jon back to their camp at the base of the talus. A California\nHighway Patrol helicopter transported Dan to the hospital in Mammoth Lakes, where\nit was confirmed he had fractured his right ankle in two places. (Sources: Dan and Jon.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThe direct cause of this accident was a fall on less-than-vertical terrain. Especially in\nremote areas, climb conservatively to avoid falls in terrain where lack of protection\nor ledges indicate injury potential. Dan acknowledged that this climb was at the top\nreach of his limits, and because of a biking injury he had sustained two months prior,\nhe had not been climbing much in the lead-up to this trip.\n    Jon was unable to see Dan when he fell and may have had more slack in the belay\n system than normal. It can be tricky to manage the rope when the leader is out of sight,\nand care is required to prevent slack from inadvertently piling on ledges or in cracks.\n     Dan also indicated that he felt rushed by the second party catching up to them,\ndespite everyone\u2019s apparent patience. He was trying to climb quickly to be courteous,\nwhen he should have prioritized climbing safely. In popular areas like the Incredible\nHulk, finding multiple parties on the same route is common. While it can be frustrat-\ning to be stuck behind a slower party, patience and good communication usually will\nlead to an opportunity for the faster team to pass.\n     The second party in this incident is to be commended for having the skills to\nexecute an effective self-rescue, having the appropriate communication device\nto call for assistance, and helping Dan and Jon down the talus. The climbers were\nfortunate the accident was early in the day, the weather permitted a helicopter to\nfly, and the second team carried a satellite communication device. (Dan and Jon had\na cell phone, but there is no reception in this area.) Without these things, the injured\nparty might have endured a long wait for help.

        "Details_Factors": "Crowded Climb\nYosemite National Park, Tuolumne Meadows, Cathedral Peak\nJohn and Chris (30-year-old males) were on their first climbing trip to Yosemite, and\nCathedral was their first objective. They had climbed together frequently in the past,\nand had completed a three-day course in multi-pitch trad climbing in 2017. They were\ncomfortable leading 5.8 with traditional gear.\n    On October 6, they arrived at the base of Cathedral around noon. They could see\nfour or five other parties on the popular southeast buttress: two parties down low\nand one higher up with three people. At this point, they decided to seek variations\nthat would allow them to avoid other parties. They simul-climbed the first couple of\npitches, with John leading the first block and Chris leading the second block, which\ntook them to the level of the chimney about three pitches up.\n    At this point, one party was in the chimney with another party waiting at its base.\nBecause of the crowds, Chris chose to set up his anchor on the ledge about 30 feet\nto the left of the chimney and bring John up to there. They planned to pitch out the\nclimbing from this point, since they were entering harder terrain. According to the\nSupertopo topo they had with them, the climbing to the left of the chimney went at 5.7.\n    Chris had built his anchor in a left-facing corner, but John opted to climb further\nleft on the face in order to avoid climbing directly through the anchor. As John\nclimbed off the ledge, he got himself into an awkward position that didn\u2019t feel like\n5.7 climbing, and with his feet approximately six to eight feet off the ledge, he barn-\ndoored off. At this point he hadn\u2019t placed any gear, and as he began to fall he made\nthe split-second decision to try and land on the ledge rather than push off the wall\nand risk a factor 2 fall on the anchor.\n    John landed awkwardly on his feet and stumbled into a sitting position. He imme-\ndiately knew that he had injured his legs. Continuing up wasn\u2019t an option, and though\nSupertopo showed a bail option off the right side of Cathedral, that would still involve\nhiking down through unfamiliar terrain. John and Chris decided their best strategy\n would be to self-rescue to the base and receive further help there.\n    Chris and John began rapping the route, leaving gear and slinging horns for\nanchors every 30 meters, since they only had one rope. John used one hand as his\nbrake hand and the other to push himself away from the wall. At 3:23 p.m., he called\n911. Ten minutes later, two responders were dispatched on foot from Tuolumne\nMeadows and a helicopter was ordered.\n    As Chris was setting up their fourth rappel anchor (approximately 150 feet off\nthe ground), they saw two soloists arrive at the base. The soloists happened to be\nex-YOSAR members and medical professionals, and they climbed over to help the pair\nwith patient care and anchor building, and then lowered John down the final pitches\nwith one of the responders, who at that point had arrived on scene.\n    At the base, John was assessed and splinted, and at 6:13 p.m. he was flown away\nfrom the scene by helicopter. He was diagnosed with fractures in both ankles.\n\nANALYSIS\nRight above the ledge where John fell was a finger size crack, which he used for hand\nholds but not for protection. Placing good gear early when climbing off the ground\nor above a ledge can often prevent injury in the event of a fall.\n    The crowding on this very popular route not only adds objective hazards such as\nrockfall but also changes the entire mindset of parties who are feeling the pressure\nof crowds. Rather than focusing on climbing the best line, John and Chris opted for\nless desirable variations and were operating in a hastier mindset, which can affect\ndecision-making and risk analysis. This is not the first accident on this climb where\ncrowds were likely a contributing factor. The rock is not going anywhere\u2014if there are\ntoo many people, another route or a different day might be a safer choice.\n    John and Chris\u2019 ability to safely build anchors and rappel most of the route helped\nimmensely to expedite the rescue. However, some skills were rusty, such as how\na rescuer can rappel with a patient (tandem rappel), which would have sped their\ndescent and provided better patient care. Learn these skills and then practice them\noften, before they are needed. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)",

Yosemite Search and\nRescue was busy on a serious call, so the pair spent the night at the anchor on a six-\ninch-wide ledge. The following morning, two members of YOSAR climbed Royal\nArches and rappelled from above to access the stranded climbers\u2019 rope.

While\none person pulls the rope, the other can watch for knots, snarls, or serious twists.\n   If the rope gets stuck at the anchor above, the climbers must decide whether to\nascend the rope, lead back to the anchor using whatever rope and protection are\navailable, continue to descend with whatever rope can be salvaged, or wait for help.\nEvery situation is different, and Chad and Ben were well prepared for the decision\nthey made, with extra layers, headlamps, sufficient water, and cell phones to call for\nhelp.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Failures, Fatigue\nYosemite Valley, El Capitan, Salath\u00e9 Wall\nIn mid-June, Rylan Knuttgen and John Shields started up the Salath\u00e9 Wall. Both were\nexperienced climbers with four decades of trad climbing between them, including\nmultiple big walls. They had been prepping for the Salath\u00e9 Wall specifically for the last\n18 months and felt physically and mentally prepared for the route.\n    The climb went well until, on June 15, they trended too far right on pitch 26, lead-\ning to Sous le Toit ledge from the Block. After encountering tricky aid and loose rock,\nthey realized they were off-route and were able to rappel back to the Block and then\ncontinue on the correct line. However, this cost them about seven hours, and they\ndidn\u2019t arrive at Long Ledge, their planned bivy site, until 4:30 a.m. on the 16th.\n    By midmorning they were awake and preparing for the final four pitches of the\nroute. They had received a weather report the previous day calling for a chance\nof thunderstorms in the afternoon, and they wanted to be off the wall before bad\nweather arrived.\n    At this point they had to decide between the original aid route off Long Ledge,\nwhich heads up a C2 crack on the far right side, and a free variation that follows bolts\nup steep rock above the left side. The free variation is given a grade of 5.11d/5.12a,\nwhereas the climbing above the C2 crack is rated 5.8 in the Supertopo guidebook.\nHowever, they also had a topo from MountainProject.com that showed \u201c5.10b R\npolished knobs\u201d on the right-hand line, and they were aware of the notoriety of\n that pitch. [Editor\u2019s Note: There\nhave been many long falls from this\npitch, including ones causing serious\ninjuries.] When gathering beta for\nthe climb in the Valley beforehand,\nthey had not found anyone who had\nclimbed the left variation, and so\nwere hesitant to go that way, despite\ntheir topo suggesting it might be the\n\u201cbest way.\u201d After discussing their\noptions, they opted to follow the\nright-hand line.\n    John took the lead and was feel-\ning good despite their lack of sleep.\nAt the top of the crack, he found a Topo showing two options for the notorious pitch above\n                                          Long Ledge, high on the Salath\u00e9 Wall. The best choice\nfixed gray Fixe Alien Revolution that will depend on the leader\u2019s Yosemite free climbing\nlooked to be in good shape, and he skills. Pep Soldevila | Mountain Project\nclipped it as pro. (He had approxi-\nmately seven pieces of pro in the crack below that.) Here, the available gear place-\nments start to dwindle and then disappear. Above the fixed piece, John was able to\nplace a black (tiny) Alien, but had very little confidence the piece would hold a fall.\nJohn had to switch to free climbing and communicated that to Rylan. He also noted\nthat a piton shown by Supertopo was missing. As John climbed through the polished\nknobs, he shouted down to Rylan that it would be \u201ca hell of a whipper\u201d if he fell, and\nas he was readjusting his feet to reach the final jug he slipped.\n    John fell from approximately 12 feet above his last piece and swung to the right\nas multiple pieces failed under load. He narrowly missed hitting Long Ledge and\nultimately stopped about 20 feet below the ledge, after taking a fall of 50 to 60 feet.\nHe had hit the wall several times on the way down. John immediately recognized he\nwould need a rescue because of injuries (multiple broken bones), but took it upon\nhimself to ascend his rope and get back onto Long Ledge.\n    Attached to his rope was the black Alien (an expected failure), part of the fixed\nAlien, which had broken at the stem, and one extra sling that most likely came\nunclipped from a piece below the Alien. John was most likely caught by a number 1\nBlack Diamond C4, which was approximately 20 to 25 feet below his fall point.\n    After a quick assessment, during which they determined John had no head or spine\ninjury, Rylan tried to call 911 multiple times but was unable to get through. Knowing\nthere were parties below them, they started shouting for someone to call for help.\nA party on Mammoth Terraces (nearly 2,000 feet below) heard them and called 911.\n    A helicopter was ordered to make contact with the parties, and though unable to\ncommunicate verbally, John and Rylan indicated that they needed help by waving.\nYOSAR team members were flown to the top of El Capitan to launch a top-down extri-\ncation of the party, who were about 400 feet below the rim. A rescuer was lowered to\nthe pair and then raised back to the top with John in a litter and then again with Rylan.\nJohn was flown from the summit. He sustained multiple injuries to the left side of his\nbody, including a fractured ulna, tibia/fibula, and talus bones.\n\n ANALYSIS\nThe failure of two or more pieces was a major factor in turning what might have\nbeen a long but reasonably safe fall into a very long and damaging fall. Be extremely\ncautious with fixed gear, which may be significantly damaged or weakened (or poorly\nplaced). There\u2019s a chance John could have removed the fixed cam and used his own\npiece in that placement. It\u2019s also possible that a different piece than the black Alien\nmight have caught his fall. Especially with micro-cams, slight variance in size (often\nnecessitating a different brand of protection) can make a huge difference in the\npiece\u2019s holding power. When facing a runout above critical pieces, take the time to\nbe confident of the quality of each gear placement.\n    After three days on the wall and their late night beforehand, this team was not at\ntheir peak climbing shape. They were also feeling the pressure of possible thunder-\nstorms. John and Rylan had enough food and water for extra time on the wall and a\nfly for their portaledge to wait out a storm. It\u2019s possible that if they had rested and\nrecovered, they might have avoided the fall.\n    These climbers had thoroughly researched their climb by looking at multiple topos\nand talking to others who had been on the route. Their decision to take the right-\nhand variation off Long Ledge made sense, given the information they had gathered.\nHowever, had they been able to talk with a climber who had done the left-hand varia-\ntion, which goes with reachy 5.10+ free climbing and aid off bolts, they might have\ngone that way.

Climber 1, an experienced climber in her 30s, was\nleading when she found herself off-route. Nervous about downclimbing, she climbed\nto a fixed nut and planned to lower back to the belay. However, when she weighted\nthe nut, it pulled out.

Emerson, Southeast Face\nIn the late afternoon of September 15, hikers on the Piute Pass Trail reported that\nthey heard calls for help and saw people waving their arms on the rugged southeast\nface of Mt. Emerson (13,204 feet). Two Inyo County Search and Rescue members were\ndispatched to the scene, where they encountered one member of a three-person\nclimbing party at the base of the face. He informed them that he and his two compan-\nions had been attempting the southeast face (III 5.4), but became lost and determined\nthey could not continue. This climber was able to downclimb to the base to seek help,\nwhile his two companions were stranded several hundred feet up. During the night,\nthe SAR team ascended about 1,000 feet up the face but were unable to locate the\ntwo stranded climbers. They decided to bivouac at 2:30 a.m.\n    At daybreak on the morning of September 16, the two rescuers continued search-\ning for the stranded climbers, but eventually decided to retreat due to high winds and\nfalling temperatures. During their retreat, at about 9:30 a.m., rocks fell from above\n(likely dislodged by the high wind), striking one rescuer on his right forearm and\nfracturing his radius and ulna, and on his right hip, causing deep soft-tissue damage.\nThe team alerted the SAR base about their situation, and an additional team of eight\nSAR members was dispatched to assist the injured rescuer. Helicopter support was\nunavailable due to extremely high winds.\n    While the injured rescuer and his partner waited for help, they encountered the\ntwo purportedly stranded climbers coming up the southeast face, having elected to\ncontinue after bivouacking off-route. The two climbers were advised to wait with the\ninjured SAR member and his teammate. Once the additional SAR members arrived on\nscene, they stabilized their injured teammate and lowered him approximately 1,000\n feet to the bottom of the face. The climbers were also assisted to the bottom, using\na combination of belayed downclimbing, lowering, and tandem rappelling.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe stranded climbers drastically underestimated their objective. Although the\nsoutheast face of Mt. Emerson has a modest rating of 5.4, the route-finding is not\nobvious and the route is long. The climbers left a rope and anchoring material at the\nbase of the route, thinking they would not need it after the crux first pitch. Had they\nbrought this gear with them, it might have given them the means to retreat. They\nalso were unprepared for spending a long time on the route and became extremely\ncold as a result. The initial call for rescue was due to the combination of these factors.\n    The rockfall that injured the SAR member was a random, spontaneous event.\nAlthough the SAR hasty team recognized that conditions were deteriorating and\ndecided to retreat, they fell victim to the objective dangers inherent to the moun-\ntains. Overall, this incident illustrates the importance of having the requisite experi-\nence for a given objective\u2014and the skills and gear needed for self-rescue\u2014and it is a\nreminder that rescuers expose themselves to risk of injury in order to assist stranded\nor injured parties.

I\u2019ve never relied on gear in questionable/unknown condition before.\nIt\u2019s possible my decision-making was compromised by the previous days of climbing.\n     My takeaways from the accident:\n    (1) Whenever possible, perform a standardized self-check and partner check of\n        your system prior to climbing, rappelling, or during any transition.\n    (2) Consider resting or aborting the trip if feeling physically or mentally fatigued.\n    (3) Acclimatize sufficiently before strenuous and technical trips at high altitude.\n    (4) Back up and test single-piece fixed anchors. Avoid using weathered anchors\n        if not backed up or replaced with new material.\n    (5) Avoid very short rappels if it would be reasonable to downclimb.

The climbers got off-route on the\nupper section and descended a short distance to reassess. At this point, a large\nblock dislodged and fell, striking a 54-year-old male climber in the head and causing\na tumbling fall of about 1,000 feet onto the upper Palisade Glacier.

Nearby climbers, many with medical and rescue\n training, heard the fall and quickly arrived on scene. They noted that three pieces\nhad pulled out, including two nuts and a number 2 Camalot. A large nut had caught\nthe climber\u2019s fall. None of the pieces that pulled had been extended, and a fixed piton\non the route was not clipped.\n    The climber inverted during the fall and impacted a rock just above the ground.

We are new climbers (less than two years), but I had\ntaken several classes and regularly practiced rope skills at home. Midway through\nthe afternoon, I tied in to lead Twice Stung and Forever Shy (5.10-), a 60-foot climb\nseveral grades below what I\u2019d previously sent. The route sits about five feet to the\nleft of a dihedral with an offwidth running up it. We hoped to top-rope the offwidth\nonce I built an anchor at the top.\n    Above the halfway point, I hesitated for several minutes as I tried to figure out\nwhere to go. Seeing easier climbing above, I decided to just go for it. I fell and dropped\nabout 15 feet, swung to the right, and ended up upside down, unconscious, and with\nmy shoulder stuck in the offwidth. Despite wearing a helmet, I had a head wound that\nproduced a significant amount of blood, and I was unable to be lowered. A nearby\nclimber was able to free solo up an easier route to reach me, pull me out of the\noffwidth, and help lower me safely. I regained consciousness as I was righted. We were\nlucky to have a cell signal, and I was evacuated by helicopter to the hospital, where\nI was treated for a concussion, scalp laceration, blood loss, and a sprained thumb.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis incident was the result of my inexperience. While there were a number of compo-\nnents that caused injury (flipping upside down, swinging due to poor position, hitting\nthe wall at just the right angle to cause a wound underneath my helmet, getting stuck\nwhile unconscious, etc.), many of these factors would have been mitigated or rendered\nmoot with better awareness and technique that come with more experience.

        "Details_Factors": "Storm, Darkness, Inexperience\nSangre de Cristo Range, Crestone Needle, Ellingwood Ledges\nOn Friday, June 21, two climbers from Kansas (ages 23 and 30) drove up to the east\nside of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Their goal was the Ellingwood Ledges (a.k.a.\nEllingwood Ar\u00eate) on the east side of Crestone Needle. The 2,000-foot route ends at\nthe summit of the 14,197-foot peak.\n    The next morning, under sunny skies, they started climbing at 9 a.m. via the route\u2019s\ndirect start. Their iPhone weather app showed a forecast of \u201cpartly cloudy with a\n20% chance of showers.\u201d Enjoying warm weather and dry rock, the duo made good\ntime cruising the easy 5th-class pitches at the bottom and the grassy and rocky 3rd-\nand 4th-class ledges in the middle of the route. However, at the route\u2019s crux, just a\nfew hundred feet below the summit, the 5.7 to 5.9 cracks (depending on exact route)\nwere filled with ice. Clad in rock shoes and with no ice axes, they couldn\u2019t climb past\nthe thin ribbons of ice. Meanwhile, the sky turned gray as, unbeknownst to the pair,\na strong winter-like storm was barreling in from the west.\n    Around 4 p.m. the storm hit, with intense snow showers along with thunder and\nlightning. The pair put on their light fleece jackets and waterproof jackets. With visi-\nbility dropping to 30 feet, they kept trying to climb, thinking safety would be gained\nby going over the top and descending the standard route. (The 3rd-class normal\nroute up and down Crestone Needle is exposed and tricky to follow, and has stranded\nclimbers even in the best weather.) Eventually, realizing they could not go up, the pair\ncalled the Custer County Sheriff\u2019s Office to request assistance. It was about 5:30 p.m.\n    Custer County Search and Rescue (CCSAR) began planning for a possible tech-\nnical rescue. The climbers started down, building rappel anchors and occasionally\ndownclimbing, a descent they described as \u201cterrifying.\u201d They made steady progress\nand continued to give updates to CCSAR. (Cell service is very good high on the Cres-\ntones.) At approximately 9:30 p.m. and at 13,030 feet, soaked and shivering hard, and\nnearly out of gear to build anchors, the pair grew concerned their fatigue could affect\n their safety if they continued. In a call with CCSAR, a senior member told them not to\ncontinue down if they were not completely confident in their anchors. They decided\nto stop and wait for morning on a snow-covered ledge about as wide as a lawn chair.\n    Given the complexity of the situation, CCSAR began planning a parallel rescue\neffort: one ground-based and another by helicopter hoist. Members of various other\nrescue teams started toward the area to help, and a line of communication was\nopened with the Colorado Army National Guard (COANG).\n    High on the mountain, light snow continued to fall until about 1 a.m., and then,\nas the skies cleared, the temperature dropped into the lower 20s (F). Their sodden\nclothing froze hard and their joints turned stiff. They had found no gear placements,\nso they had no anchor. Afraid to even stand up for fear they might fall, they stayed\nput. The two were so miserable and scared that they each called parents and siblings\nto say good-bye, thinking they might die before sunrise.\n    By 3 a.m., rescue teams started to arrive at CCSAR\u2019s base in Westcliffe. An hour\nlater, over 20 mountain rescuers from four counties were hiking toward the base of\nEllingwood Ar\u00eate. All the while, CCSAR liaised with the National Guard to coordinate\na helicopter extraction utilizing two Alpine Rescue Team hoist rescue technicians.\nWeather conditions were questionable, and it was not until well after sunrise that\nthe helicopter mission became a \u201cgo.\u201d After a 130-mile flight, Black Hawk 529 out of\nBuckley Air Force Base arrived overhead at about 9:45 a.m. and determined a hoist\ninsert and extraction was possible.\n\n\n   MAKING THE CALL: CELL PHONES AND RESCUES\n   In the Crestone Needle rescue, the ability to maintain two-way communications\n   with rescuers was critical. The stranded climbers not only could call for help, they\n   also were able to discuss their situation with rescuers, and the conversations\n   with rescuers and family helped keep them motivated during a long, cold night.\n       To preserve battery power, rescuers instructed the pair to limit outside calls.\n   Too often, people who call for help start calling other people as well, draining\n   their battery and leaving rescuers with no way to stay in touch. (It should go with-\n   out saying that batteries shouldn\u2019t be wasted on Instagram or checking email.)\n   This pair limited their calls and preserved one phone throughout the night.\n       It\u2019s not just battery life that\u2019s at stake in deciding who to call in such a situ-\n   ation, because an accident in the mountains affects many people. Unsure they\n   would survive the night, the two climbers called their families to say \u201cgood-\n   byes,\u201d an experience that caused huge swings in emotions. At one point, a family\n   member\u2019s call went to voicemail, and only hours later did one of the climbers\n   answer another call and report that both were still alive. To unexpectedly be\n   talking over a phone to a loved one who is sure they are on the verge of death\n   generates a level of fear and sadness that is difficult to describe. Fortunately,\n   these climbers and their families got a second chance.\n                                                                           \u2014 Dale Atkins\n    Two rescue techs were lowered to the stranded climbers. Other than being very\ncold, stiff, hungry, and thirsty, the climbers were in remarkably good condition. The\nmorning sun had thawed and dried their clothes, and warmed their spirits. The two\nwere helped into rescue harnesses, and when the Black Hawk returned, the climbers\nand rescuers were hoisted two at a time and flown to CCSAR\u2019s base in Westcliffe. By 2:45\np.m., all the ground teams had returned safely to Westcliffe, ending a 22-hour mission.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe two climbers were capable multi-pitch crag climbers who aspired to do their\nfirst alpine or big-mountain route. They had the skill to climb this route in summer\nconditions; however, the preceding winter had been one of Colorado\u2019s snowiest in\nmany years. Though the calendar said late June, snow and ice on the high mountains\nwas similar to mid-May. The arrival of the storm only worsened the situation.\n    The storm had been well forecasted for the mountains, but the pair did not get the\nright forecast. Many phone apps present weather for nearby towns, so the climbers\ngot the forecast for Westcliffe, located in the valley to the northeast of the mountain.\nThen they typed in \u201cCrestone\u201d and another benign forecast popped up\u2014however,\nthis forecast was for the hamlet of Crestone, low in a valley on the west side of the\npeak. Seeing two good forecasts, the climbers were confident. But there was a very\ndifferent forecast for the peaks 6,000 feet higher. [Editor\u2019s Note: 14ers.com links to\nNOAA spot forecasts for each of the Colorado 14ers.]\n    The climbers had a good alpine rack but left nearly all of it as they rappelled and\ndownclimbed nearly 1,000 feet of snow-covered rock and grass. In their packs they\ncarried shell jackets, beanies, gloves, and good socks\u2014barely enough protection.\nThey climbed in rock shoes and carried light trail shoes for the descent. In a typical\nsummer, these shoes would have been fine, but had they reached the summit, their\ndescent off a very snowy and icy Broken Hand Pass would have been difficult.\n    To their credit, these climbers kept their wits and survived a miserable night in\na very exposed spot. They tried very hard to self-rescue and did a phenomenal job\nto descend as far as they did.\n    The role of luck\u2014good and bad\u2014plays a much larger role than we often acknowl-\nedge in such situations. In the Sangre de Cristo Range, the weather cleared soon\nafter midnight, leaving the climbers with drying conditions. Further north in Colo-\nrado\u2019s central and northern mountains, the storm continued all night, and upwards\nof two feet of snow fell. These two put themselves in a place to be lucky when they\nwisely decided to stop. Surviving a miserable night is always easier than surviving a\nfall.

I remember clipping one\nlast nut before starting to traverse over to the upper anchors, at the top of the cliff.\nThe limestone was loose and crumbly. The last thing that I remember was calling\ndown to Will and asking, \u201cHey! Where did you go from here?\u201d I am guessing my hand\nslipped on the loose rock, and I fell. I was told the rock where my last nut was placed\nbasically exploded from the force of my fall. With the nut gone, there was too much\nslack in the system to stop me from hitting the ground 60 feet below.

The climber fell\non easier terrain after completing an airy traverse on the sixth pitch of the ascent,\nand he hit a right-facing ramp, sustaining a leg injury that was later determined to\nbe a displaced distal tibia-fibula fracture.\n    Around 1:30 p.m., park visitors reported they had heard yelling for help from inside\nthe canyon. The climbing ranger, Tom Schaefer, directed a ranger on the opposite rim\nof the canyon to use binoculars and a spotting scope to locate the injured climber and\nhis partner. They determined that the climbing party was self-rescuing to the bottom of\nthe canyon by rappelling the route, with the injured climber using only one leg. Schae-\nfer attempted to contact the party from the rim with a megaphone but was unable to\nestablish communication. He activated the volunteer SAR team and began to prepare\n a rigging plan to assist the climber out of\nthe canyon if necessary.\n    Schaefer and two volunteer SAR nurses\nmet the climbing party as they reached\nthe bottom of the canyon around 6 p.m.\nThe injured climber was unable to walk,\nmaking it impossible to hike out via the\nCruise Gully. At this point, a decision was\nmade to conduct a rope raise of the injured\nclimber the next day.

NPS Photo\n    At 7 a.m., a Dual Capability Twin\nTension Rope System was set up on the rim, using two 360-meter ropes followed by\ntwo 180-meter ropes. While the injured climber and SAR team sheltered under an\noverhanging cave feature, some loose rock was cleaned off the lower portion of the\nroute. The litter was then lowered to the bottom and the injured climber hauled to\nthe rim. The entire operation took six hours, with the raise itself taking two hours.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climber fell a long way on easier terrain, and he later acknowledged he should\nhave placed another piece to minimize the potential fall. Due to the technical terrain\nand remoteness of the Black Canyon\u2019s rim, response times can be elongated. There\nis no cell phone reception, and even personal locator beacons may not function\nproperly inside the narrow canyon. The only ways rangers can track who is in the\ncanyon is the self-registration wilderness-use permit system. A large majority of\nrescues in the canyon are reported in late afternoon, and most inner canyon rescues\nrequire overnight patient care while a rescue plan is organized and conducted the\nnext day. The lesson is that a conservative approach is required while climbing in\nthis environment. (Sources: Tom Schaefer, climbing ranger, and the injured climber.)",

I should have made more of an effort to figure out this particular pitch\nbefore setting out.\n    Pay attention to rappel stations while you climb. One of my friends who came\nto our rescue had climbed the route twice previously and knew where the rappel\nstations were. This saved us time and gear on the descent.\n    Don\u2019t trust fixed pitons. I had so little gear on the pitch that I was ecstatic when\nI found a piton. It gave me unwarranted peace of mind, and without it I may have\ntaken more care in testing the holds. However, it is possible the piton slowed my fall\nbefore it failed.\n    Know self-rescue techniques and wilderness first aid. I have taken multiple self-\nrescue classes and first-aid courses. My husband is certified in wilderness first aid,\nand we have reviewed self-rescue together. This enabled us to quickly come up with\na plan and calm each other down. Thankfully, we had friends nearby who came to\nour aid, as it would have been quite time-consuming to retreat with one rope, and\nwe would have lost a lot of gear.

Mitch elected to lead Tree of Knowledge (5.10b sport), and I put up the route\nEast of Eden (5.9 trad). We swapped top-rope belays and discussed our dinner plans\nas the sun began to drop behind the hills. As we were packing up, I saw Mitch racking\nup draws and eyeing the route Fish and Whistle (5.11a/b sport), which climbs the ar\u00eate\nabove the road. I had done this route during my spring break trip, and we discussed\n the low crux and the potential for ground fall, but\nMitch decided he wanted to give it a try.\n    This route starts only a few feet off the highway,\nso I built a ground anchor for myself to prevent us\nfrom rolling into the road in the event of an early fall.\nWe did our final checks, and Mitch started up the\nroute. He clipped the first two bolts without issue\nand started through the crux. He took a short (one\nmeter) fall at the crux and rested for a moment. He\nthen proceeded to make quick work of the crux and\ncontinued toward the third bolt. Here, he struggled\nto find a good stance to clip and quickly went from\nlooking strong and calm to distressed. He contin-\nued up and right until the waist of his harness was\nlevel with the third bolt. He managed to attach a\nquickdraw to the hanger and tried to clip the rope.\nHe nearly had the rope clipped when he fell off.\n    I felt the rope go tight and was pulled off the\nground. Because of his position, he fell slightly back\nand impacted a rock outcropping, with the back of Fish and Whistle in Poudre Canyon,\n                                                          with the second and third bolt loca-\nhis head and the upper part of his torso striking first.\n                                                          tions shown.

I had a good base of first-aid skills, and I performed\nCPR on Mitch for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, which resulted in a detectable\nheartbeat and him breathing under his own power. I quickly assessed Mitch for any\nother treatable injuries, but found nothing. The bleeding from his head had slowed\nsignificantly, and he appeared to be breathing on his own. Blood had been pooling in\nhis airway, so we monitored him extremely closely to keep him from choking.\n    We did not have cell reception, but were able to flag down several passing cars\nwithin minutes. Eventually an ambulance and several vehicles from the Larimer\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office arrived on scene. A helicopter later landed on the road and\nbrought additional personnel and equipment. Unfortunately, Mitch slowly began to\ndeteriorate; his breathing slowed, pulse faded, and he became completely unrespon-\nsive. Hunter and I were ushered away, and we were sitting behind our car, away from\nthe scene, when one of the paramedics came over and informed us Mitch had passed.\n\nANALYSIS\nMitch (age 22) and I were regular climbing and training partners. He was strong,\noften flashing my gym projects and placing in local climbing competitions. But most\nof his climbing had been done in the gym, and though his basic skills were pretty\nsolid, he had much to learn about outdoor climbing. Fish and Whistle would have\nbeen his hardest sport climb to date. Learning to read the rock, where the best line\n and clipping stances are found, and how to back off when things turn ugly are vital\nskills that I don\u2019t think Mitch had fully developed. It\u2019s also possible that a long stick\nclip could have been used to clip the first few bolts, in order to minimize ground\nfall potential.\n    Most climbers doing this route make crux moves onto the left side of the ar\u00eate\nand then reach a good hold for clipping the third bolt; Mitch stayed in a corner\non the right until the third bolt was at his waist but out of reach. After this tragic\naccident, the local climber who bolted this route decided to add an optional bolt\non the right to protect climbers who stray onto this path.

The man and his climbing partner\nhad just completed the second pitch of Cosmosis (5.10a) and were searching for a\nbolted rappel station. The pair unroped and began scrambling climber\u2019s left toward\nthe anchor. The climber stated to his partner that the terrain looked easy and that he\nfelt comfortable traversing it, but as they were scrambling he fell. His partner didn\u2019t\nwitness the fall, but other climbers in the area described a rock dislodging under the\nclimber as he was scrambling.\n    Climbers at the crag reached the patient on a ledge and found him unresponsive.\nA Boulder ranger responded, and the climber was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nANALYSIS\nMost parties do only the classic first pitch of Cosmosis, which can be descended via\na single lower or rappel from a bolted anchor. Since the second pitch doesn\u2019t have\na fixed anchor at its top, continuing up that pitch meant choosing among several\ndescent options, including the scramble to reach a rappel station to the east or a\nwalk-off to the southwest. Nearly every year, this publication records one or more\nfatal unroped falls from the tops of cliffs, often as climbers search for descent routes.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to encounter loose rock or slippery vegetation and dirt on cliff-\ntop edges.

I had placed one piece (number 0.5 C4 Camalot) about six to eight feet off the\nground, with an unextended alpine draw (the route went straight up so rope drag was\nnot an issue). There was a slick hand jam that I couldn\u2019t stick, despite having done it\nabout an hour before, and I fell about two feet. The gear caught my fall as expected. The\n piece did not move and was still in a textbook placement on solid rock. I tried the move\nagain with the same result. I checked the security of the piece after the second fall;\neverything looked fine. On the third try I fell again and, in a freak occurrence, the rope-\nend carabiner on my alpine draw opened and the rope disconnected from the draw.\n   I fell about eight feet and hit the deck, then tumbled over a series of boulders down\nthe climbers\u2019 trail another 25 feet, stopping just shy of a bushy cliff. Some willows\nwere the only thing stopping me from tumbling far down to the road below.\n   John had braced for my fall, but when the rope unweighted after the cam was\nunclipped, he lost his balance. As I fell, I pulled him down the trail with me. He tumbled\nover a four-foot boulder and stopped. When I sat up, the rope-end carabiner was\nattached to my rope while my cam and the rest of the alpine draw still sat in the crack.\n   Two nearby climbers with medical training helped me tape my leg and clean our\nwounds before assisting us down the trail to our vehicle. Both John and I had abrasions\nand bruises, and I also sustained whiplash, but X-rays did not show further injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nInitially I suspected I might have grabbed the carabiner\nin panic as I fell and that might have caused the gate\nto open. However, after re-creating the scenario on\nan indoor wall, this does not seem likely. The most\nlikely scenario is the carabiner spun so that, before\nor during my fall, my tie-in knot, my body, the sling,\nor the rope caused the gate to open, similar to fall-\ning on a backclipped quickdraw, and resulted in the\ncarabiner disconnecting from the sling. This would be Grivel Twin Gate carabiner.\na rare occurrence, but within the realm of possibility.\n    Since the accident, we\u2019ve been using special carabiners with two opposing gates for\nour first piece or any piece near a crux move. [Editor\u2019s Note: A locking carabiner is also\na good option.] While my ground fall might have been unavoidable, my 25-foot tumble\nafter hitting the deck could have been shortened if we had anchored the belayer so he\nwouldn\u2019t be pulled off balance. Even in seemingly inconsequential terrain, the momen-\ntum of such falls should not be underestimated.\n    Both John and I were wearing helmets, and we suspect we might have been more\nseriously injured as we tumbled over the rocks if we hadn\u2019t been.

To reach Swanson Ar\u00eate, which begins from Red Ledge partway\nup the cliff, Climber 1 started with the first pitch of the Great Zot (5.8+). Above this, he\n clipped a bolted anchor at the top of neighboring West Chimney route and traversed\nthe broad Red Ledge to the base of Swanson Ar\u00eate. While navigating these ledges or the\nstart of Swanson Ar\u00eate, the climber pulled off a microwave-size block and fell, even-\ntually coming to a stop on Red Ledge. He had placed no gear after the bolted anchor.\n    Although unresponsive at first, Climber 1 was vocal after 15 seconds and quickly\nself-diagnosed a broken leg. Still on the ground, Climber 2 called 911 immediately.\nGiven the uncertainty about a spinal injury, Climber 2 opted to wait for rescuers\ninstead of trying to lower Climber 1 to the ground.\n    Another party was descending West Chimney, and one of the climbers untied,\nsoloed the last third of the West Chimney (5.6) to reach the injured climber, and\nthen fixed a rope that could be used by rescuers to reach Climber 1. Rocky Moun-\ntain Rescue Group responded, reaching the site within an hour of the initial 911 call.\nClimber 1 sustained a broken femur, spinal fracture, broken wrist, four broken ribs,\nand a punctured lung; he has made a full recovery and returned to climbing.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis accident is difficult to analyze, since the belayer could not see the climber fall (he\njust heard \u201cfalling\u201d), and Climber 1 does not remember details. Our crags are dynamic\nplaces, constantly shifting. Even on well-traveled classics, we must remain vigilant\nin evaluating rock and potentially adjust our tactics in loose terrain by placing more\nprotection or establishing intermediate belays.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection for Second\nEldorado Canyon, The Bastille\nOn September 9 at about 9 a.m., my friend Austin and I set out to climb Werk Supp\non the north face of the Bastille. I led the first pitch (5.8+), placing protection only\nwhere I felt that I needed it. The pitch ends by pulling over a slight bulge, protected\nby a cam, onto a slanted ledge. There is a bolted anchor about 10 feet to the left on\nthis ledge and at a downward angle. I traversed the ledge to belay from this anchor,\nso I was located slightly lower and far to the left of my last piece of protection.\n    At the final bulge, Austin removed my last cam and attempted the finishing mantel\nmove for about 10 minutes, then fell off and took a significant pendulum swing onto\na rock bulge directly below where I was belaying. We both heard a pop, and Austin\nyelled that his foot was in intense pain.\n    I rigged a 3-to-1 assisted haul to bring him up to the belay ledge, so I could inspect\nhis ankle. It had immediately become very swollen, but at the time we only suspected\na severe sprain. I lowered Austin directly to the ground and then rappelled to join him.\nFortunately, the base of the route is only a short walk from the car. Austin initially chose\nto rest his ankle for a few days, but eventually decided to get an X-ray, which revealed\na shattered right talus and a torn sheath of the peroneus longus and brevis tendons.\n\nANALYSIS\nAustin had only climbed outside five times and never on anything this difficult.\nAs I was climbing, I was more focused on protecting the route for me than for the\n person who would be following.\nPlacing another piece of protection\nafter the final difficult move, before\nthe downward traverse, would have\nprotected the follower from a signifi-\ncant swing. Another option would\nbe to build an anchor directly above\nthe first pitch, rather than using the\nbolted anchor off to the side. [Editor\u2019s\nNote: Many climbers exit this pitch to\nthe left via a lower traverse, heading\nmore directly to the bolted anchor; this Reconstruction of a 3-to-1 haul rigged on the Werk\nis safer for the second climber.] It\u2019s also Supp anchor to help an injured climber to the ledge.

We started later in the day, arriving at the park around\n10 a.m., because the morning was cold. The park was relatively empty, but there were\nthree other parties in the small area around Rewritten: one starting the first pitch of\nRewritten, one preparing to climb West Chimney, and one beginning Swanson Ar\u00eate,\nstarting on the Red Ledge.\n    As I was flaking the rope at the base of the Rewritten, a climber on Swanson Ar\u00eate\nyelled \u201crock!\u201d and I saw a basketball-size rock coming down. I ran toward the base of\nthe climb and got in the fetal position, thinking the rock was moving outward. The\nrock hit a ledge and exploded, and a tennis ball\u2013size fragment hit my right elbow. I took\nmy shell off to find my arm covered in blood. I stepped away from the wall about ten\nmeters and pulled out a small med kit I had in my backpack. As my partner was clean-\ning the blood off my cut, a golf ball\u2013size rock landed about six inches from my big toe\n(I didn\u2019t have my climbing shoes on yet). I panicked for about 30 seconds but was able\nto calm down and move further from the wall.\n    During this time, the party climbing Rewritten had continued up the route, with\nthe leader almost at the first belay ledge. The belayer then noticed that some of their\nrope, still on the ground, had been severely damaged by the rockfall. Fortunately, that\nportion of the rope wasn\u2019t in the belay system yet. The climber decided to downclimb\nthe route. We headed back to the car.\n\nANALYSIS\nRockfall is an objective hazard at most cliffs, but some areas are more prone than\nothers. The area around Rewritten is characterized by large belay ledges covered\nin loose rock. Falling rocks are liable to bounce off ledges and can land anywhere,\n including many meters into the nearby woods. The climber on Swanson did yell \u201crock\u201d\nvery audibly, which gave us some warning.\n   Rewritten is one of the most popular routes in one of the most popular climbing\nareas in greater Denver. I made an assumption that the route wouldn\u2019t be as busy in\nDecember and after recent snow. It would have been better to arrive earlier or even\ndecide on a different route after seeing how busy it was.\n   After a rockfall incident, it\u2019s a good idea to re-flake and inspect your rope. The\nclimber on Rewritten had almost reached the top of the first pitch before the belayer\nnoticed the damaged section of rope. (Source: Anonymous injured climber.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Miscommunication, Lowering Error\nClear Creek Canyon, Other Critters Area\nOn June 6 at 12:56 p.m., the Alpine Rescue Team responded to the report of an\n18-year-old female climber who had fallen at the Other Critters area. Initial reports\nindicated the climber had fallen a significant distance and was unresponsive. While\nAlpine was en route, Clear Creek County EMS personnel were able to access the fallen\nclimber and confirm she had not survived the fall. It was estimated the climber had\nfallen a total of 160 feet.\n    After the evacuation of the fallen climber, two climbers from Alpine Rescue were\nable to access the route (Labby, 5.9 sport) and recover the climbing gear still on the\nwall. The members noted the climber\u2019s anchor setup was appropriate, all quickdraws\nwere placed properly, and no equipment failure was observed.\n    In conjunction with the Clear Creek Country Sheriff\u2019s Office, Alpine Rescue was\nable to reconstruct the events leading up to the climber\u2019s fall.\n    Somewhere between 9 and 10 a.m., Climber 1 and Climber 2 arrived at the Other\nCritters area with the intent of climbing several routes. Their first route was a\nthree-pitch bolted 5.6 called Yellow Dog Dingo. Prior to leaving the ground, the pair\ndiscussed a system to manage the belays. Climber 1 would lead each pitch, and after\nan anchor was properly established, the leader would tug on the rope two times as\nthe indication to Climber 2 to take her off belay and prepare to climb. The pair agreed\nto this system based on the crag\u2019s proximity to busy Highway 6 and their fear that\nverbal communication would be difficult. Climbers 1 and 2 successfully climbed all\nthree pitches of Yellow Dog Dingo with this system and then rappelled to the base\nof the route, where they had left their backpacks.\n    Climber 1 suggested they climb Labby next. The route starts on a wide ledge to\nclimber\u2019s right and above the start of Yellow Dog Dingo. Climber 1 set up to lead the\nroute. The plan for the route was identical to the system previously used: Two rope\ntugs meant Climber 1 was safe and Climber 2 should take her off belay and prepare\nto climb. Climber 1 believed Labby to be another multi-pitch route, and she left the\nground with the intention of tying in to the anchor and belaying Climber 2 to the\ntop. However, upon reaching the anchor, Climber 1 realized Labby was only a single-\npitch route (about 80 feet high). Climber 1 attached her anchor slings to the bolts and\nclipped her end of the rope to the master point. It\u2019s unclear if any verbal communica-\ntion to Climber 2 was attempted. Climber 1, thinking she was still on belay, sat back\non the rope to be lowered and fell.\n     From Climber 2\u2019s belay position, she could not see Climber 1 at the anchor and\nwas under the impression Climber 1 would belay her to the top. After Climber 1 disap-\npeared from view, Climber 2 felt two tugs on the rope. Based on the system they had\nagreed to use, she took Climber 1 off belay. As Climber 2 was tying herself into the\nrope, she heard a scream and saw Climber 1 fall.\n    Based on the above reconstruction, it is likely that Climber 1 pulled up on the rope\nas she set up the anchor for lowering. Having no view of the anchor and not hearing\nany verbal communication, Climber 2 felt these rope pulls and interpreted them as\nClimber 1\u2019s signal to go off belay.\n\nANALYSIS\nIt\u2019s important to highlight several oversights by the climbers in this tragic accident.\nFirst, had the pair known Labby was a single-pitch route, they might have chosen a\ndifferent rope management system. Records indicate the pair had consulted Moun-\ntain Project prior to climbing Labby but failed to identify it as a single-pitch climb.\nSecond, a non-verbal system for belay management during multi-pitch climbing is\nuseful, but relying solely on rope tugs can lead to problems. Movements in the rope\nsuch as clipping, climbing, and constructing an anchor can be misconstrued as off-\nbelay signals. Combined, these mistakes led to the fatal accident. Such incidents\nreinforce the importance of double-checking the belay before lowering by testing\nthe system with body weight before you unclip from the anchor, especially if you\ncannot hear or see the belayer below.\n     Accidents such as this have more than one victim that requires attention. The\nAmerican Alpine Club offers resources to survivors through the Climbing Grief Fund.\nAdditional information can be found at americanalpineclub.org/grieffund.

The climber\nwas on the last pitch of Black Gold (5 pitches, 5.7+), approximately 300 feet off the\nground, when the fall took place. He was not wearing a helmet and was unconscious\nfor several minutes.\n    Nearby climbers were able to access and assist the injured climber to the ground,\nwhere first responders were staged. Clear Creek Fire Authority assisted in the evac-\nuation by using a ladder truck to ferry the injured climber across the creek. At the\nhospital, the climber was diagnosed with a head injury, broken clavicle, two compres-\nsion fractures of the spine, and various contusions, but was expected to make a full\nrecovery.\n ANALYSIS\nAfter a few weeks had passed, members of\nAlpine Rescue Team were able to reach the\nsubject and conduct an in-depth interview.\nAfter climbing pitch four, the two climbers\nreached a bolted belay stance under a small\noverhang. Unclear on the route ahead, one\nof the climbers agreed to traverse out right\nof the overhang to explore the options. Prior\nto leaving the belay, the lead climber pulled\nup approximately 30 feet of rope and tied in\ndirectly to the anchor. The belayer remained\nat the anchor station but was not belaying\nthe other climber.

Both\nMountain Project (www.mountainproject.com) and the local climbing guidebook have\nample descriptions and photos of this pitch. Additionally, several system errors were\nmade as the lead climber traversed from the belay. The belayer should have remained\nin the system to prevent slack in the rope and possibly provide a more dynamic catch.\nAlso, the leader (carrying some traditional protection) could have placed gear along\nthe traverse to protect himself in the event of a fall. Finally, a helmet may have limited\nthe injury to the climber\u2019s head. (Source: Curt Honcharik, Alpine Rescue Team.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Multiple Patients\nDevils Head, Chicken Head Ranch\nJune 30 was a normal busy summer Sunday at Devils Head. We started the day on\nthe west side of Chicken Head Ranch to avoid the hot June sun. Toward midday, we\nmoved to the east side, and as usual in the summer, it started to cloud up. We climbed\nWishbone Dihedral as the weather started to break down, leaving the rope hanging\nin case it didn\u2019t rain. We had a party of four, and as we waited, two other parties of\ntwo came over to the east side of Chicken Head Ranch.\n    All eight members of the three climbing parties refrained from climbing as the\nstorm brewed to the southwest. As the storm drew closer, but before any rain or hail\nstarted, there were several lightning strikes within 500 feet. It was the worst lightning\nI had experienced in my 45 years of climbing. It was difficult to determine a safe place\nto be, as there were many tall trees and the crag nearby. Initially, several of us stayed\naway from the crag, but as the rain, wind, and hail intensified, everyone moved back\ntoward the rock. There were five of us by Wishbone Dihedral, and the other three\nwere about 50 feet to the north by Crystal Key. The lightning hit us at about 3 p.m.\n    Slowly coming back to my senses, I realized what had happened as I saw two\npeople pass out and fall into the bushes and one other person who was unconscious.\nI called out to others nearby that they should call 911, thinking they would be unaf-\nfected, but they too had been hit as the current fanned out from the top of the crag.\nI made my way to the phone in my pack and called 911, giving the details of our loca-\ntion and condition to the operator. [Editor\u2019s Note: The author of this report is one of\nthe main route developers at Devils Head and wrote the local guidebook.] Once I was\nconvinced the operator knew we were on the \u201cback\u201d of the mountain and not on the\npopular hiking trail to a fire tower, we ended the call.\n    Everyone was now conscious, but a couple members of the party had obvious\nissues, especially Sandy, who was standing behind me initially and could not speak.\nJody had a bloody nose and was somewhat dazed. The rest of the group were collect-\ning themselves and gathering warm clothes for everyone, as massive hail, rain, and\nwind continued to pummel the group. Now that it was clear there were people\ncapable of tending to those less well off, I decided to run back to the parking lot to\nensure a SAR team could find us. Another member of the group joined me for the\n20-minute trip back to the car.\n    When we reached the parking lot, a Jackson Creek fire truck and one SAR vehicle\nalready had arrived. I confirmed our group\u2019s location and the need for at least one\nstretcher with the SAR team and then raced back up to Chicken Head Ranch with an\nEMT from Jackson Creek Fire Department. When we reached the group, Sandy was\ndoing a bit better, but had an injured shoulder, and everyone was very cold. When a\nlarger SAR team arrived, Sandy was carried out in a litter, while everyone else hiked\nout under their own power. Back in the parking lot, we were checked out by para-\n\nANALYSIS\nA call to 911 within minutes of the lightning strike and great performance by the first\nresponders helped the injured get to safety relatively quickly. Looking back, it would\nhave been advisable not to move back toward the crag, which stood above the treeline\nand was hit by the lightning bolt. I had looked for a sheltered spot away from the crag\nand tall trees, but this was a massive storm with 150 ground strikes in 30 minutes in our\narea. There really was nowhere safe. I think the biggest takeaway is to stay 50 feet from\na lightning target even if it means getting really wet and cold. (Source: Tod Anderson.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Rappel Error, No Helmet\nDevils Head, Waffle House\nOn May 27 at approximately 12:30 p.m., a man in his late 20s was rappelling down\nBacon Is a Food Group (5.10 sport) and cleaning the draws when he lost his footing and\nswung over the side of an ar\u00eate. He swung about 20 feet before slamming headfirst\ninto a rock wall. He didn\u2019t have a helmet or a third-hand backup on his rappel. After\nhe hit the wall, he fell at least 10 feet to the snow-packed ground.\n    A bunch of us rushed over to him. He had a huge, bulging bruise on the left side\nof his head and blood was coming from his ear. After about seven minutes of drift-\ning in and out of consciousness, he became more alert but was not fully oriented.\n    We didn\u2019t have phone service, but eventually we were able to find a ranger who\nalerted search and rescue. They sent a helicopter, but it could not land near us due\nto tree coverage. First responders arrived on foot about an hour after the initial call.\nThe climber was placed in a litter, and a difficult evacuation began through complex\nterrain, involving multiple agencies. At the trailhead parking, he was transferred to\na Flight For Life helicopter. He was talking and responsive when they left. I spoke\nwith his wife the next day, and she told me he had fractured his skull and had brain\nbleeding/bruising but was not expected to need surgery. (Source: Brooke Silagy.)\n\nANALYSIS\nWhen cleaning a route, it is often safer to remain on belay and be lowered as opposed\nto cleaning on rappel. On this route, the bolted anchor is off to the side of an angled\nar\u00eate. When the climber lost his footing, the angle of the rappel ropes created a\npendulum effect. When a climber lowers to clean a route, they can reduce swing\npotential by clipping their harness to the belayer\u2019s side of the rope with a quickdraw;\nhowever, the climber must beware of pulling the belayer off their stance after clean-\ning the last piece. When rappelling, a fireman\u2019s belay from an anchored belayer at the\nbottom also can help prevent such swings.\n    It\u2019s worth noting the lack of helmet or backup for the rappel. Wearing a helmet\nlikely could have reduced the injury when the climber\u2019s head struck the rock, and\nusing a third-hand backup would have kept the injured climber from falling to the\nground after losing control of the brake strands.

        "Details_Factors": "Rope Too Short, No Stopper Knot\nCastle Rocks State Park, Castle Rock, Southwest Face\nOn July 21, Dan and Carolyn Morgan were climbing with a group of friends on the\nsouthwest face of Castle Rock. The pair were experienced climbers, she with 20 years\nand he with more than six years of experience. The two were staging an informal\nclimbing and rappelling clinic for their friends. Dan began ascending Red Rib (5.10a),\na route that is 190 feet high, with the goal of setting up a top-rope, and Carolyn led\nSlab Happy (5.9), just left of Red Rib, to set up a practice rappel for the others.\n    At around 10:10 a.m., Carolyn heard Dan call \u201ctake!\u201d and then \u201clower\u201d to his belayer.\nShe then heard him shout with alarm and watched him free-fall approximately 130\nfeet to the ground. According to witnesses, the single line used to lower Dan slipped\nthrough the belayer\u2019s device, causing the uncontrolled fall. No knot was tied in the\nrope end. Dan fell to a ledge about 20 feet above the base of the climb, and was imme-\ndiately tended by Carolyn and a friend, who were able to rappel down Slab Happy\nand traverse over to reach him. Dan was initially found semiconscious with labored\nbreathing, but soon passed away due to multiple traumatic blunt force injuries.\n(Sources: Carolyn Morgan, Sarah Carpenter, and Stephen King, ranger at Castle Rocks.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis incident occurred through a series of overlapping errors. Perhaps most impor-\ntantly, an atmosphere of relaxed complacency existed within the team of climbers,\nwhich may have contributed to errors in judgment, lack of awareness of the scale of\nthe climb, and a clear plan for how the climbers would ascend and descend the route.\n    Rope too short. This accident could have been avoided by assessing the height\nof the climb and the length of rope or ropes needed to complete it. A review of the\nguidebook (and a careful assessment of the cliff itself) would have alerted the climbers\n that the 70-meter rope they were using was not sufficient for lowering or rappelling\ndirectly from the top of Red Rib (190 feet or roughly 58 meters high). A second rope\nor multiple rappels is required to descend from this climb.\n    Belay system was not closed, and belayer failed to track the end of the rope. The\ninexperienced belayer complied with the request to lower and continued until the\nend of the rope slipped through her Grigri. Had either climber affixed a knot to the end\nof the rope, the accident would have been prevented. The belayer, whose experience\nwas mainly in gym settings, was unaccustomed to using the entire length of a rope\nand unquestioningly trusted the more experienced climber to make all the decisions.\nWith more instruction, the belayer would have known to monitor the center of the\nrope and to alert her climber when the rope was running short.\n    Lack of clear planning and situational awareness. This incident highlights the\nimportance of the climber clearly communicating a plan with the belayer prior to\nleaving the ground. The climber was reasonably experienced, but he misinterpreted\nthe height of the route. The goal of climbing Red Rib was to set up a top-rope for\nothers, yet the single 70-meter rope he was using would have been much too short\nto reach the ground. He then asked to be lowered from the top of the pitch, despite\nhaving already climbed nearly 60 meters. (Sources: Carolyn Morgan, Sarah Carpen-\nter, and the Editors.)",

Witnesses and responders said that a 27-year-old female\nclimber was descending from Delay of Game (5.8) when she rappelled off the end of\nher rope, falling approximately 40 feet and landing on a ledge near the base of the\nclimb. Witnesses stated that her doubled rappel rope was uneven, and there were\nno knots tied in the ends.

The climber was stabilized by EMS personnel and transported from the\nscene by helicopter. (Source: Stephen King, ranger at City of Rocks National Reserve\nand Castle Rocks State Park.)\n\nANALYSIS\nResearching this climb beforehand would have alerted the climber that rappelling this\nroute requires two ropes or an extra-long single rope. The guidebook (Bingham, 2016)\nstates that although the route is 120 feet (36.5 meters) tall, it is possible to lower or\nrappel with a single 70-meter rope with rope stretch, but they advise to knot the rope\nends. (In 2010, a climber fell to the ground when one end of a 70-meter rope passed\nthrough his belayer\u2019s device as the climber was lowering down this route.) The length\nof rope this climber used is unknown. Placing the marked center of the rope at the\nanchor before descending helps to ensure the rope ends are of equal length. If a rope\nhas no accurate center mark, both ends can be lowered simultaneously to keep them\neven. Whether the rope was too short or the ends were uneven (or both), knotting the\nrope ends could have been prevented the fall. (Source: The Editors.)",

Peter Kraines (33) and four others\nwere climbing at the Black Cliffs area near Boise. All five were experienced Air Force\nclimbers on orders to conduct climbing training. The five had been climbing since\nabout 11 a.m., and during a final training maneuver they set up a rappel station atop the\ncliff above More Than I Can Chew (5.9). Sgt. Kraines had assessed the bolted anchor\nlocated below the cliff edge and determined that reaching this anchor would create\nan unsafe situation for the less experienced climbers on the team. The group decided\nto build an anchor using removable protection at a natural bench above the cliff that\noffered a more convenient location to assemble and stage the rappel.\n     An officer who interviewed the team members at the scene described the anchor\nas a self-equalizing system comprised of two pieces of gear (a number 4 DMM Wallnut\nand a number 2 DMM Dragon cam) connected by Sterling Power Cord and carabiners,\nwith all placements positioned into vertical cracks between basalt blocks or columns.\n     Kraines and another climber were clipped to this anchor system as the rappel\nwas being readied.

During this single-line rappel, he noted some difficulty in controlling his\nspeed of descent and was unable to come to a complete stop. More than 100 feet\nfrom the bottom, when his feet were no longer able to make contact with the cliff,\nhis descent became rapid and the friction of the rope began to burn his hands.

With the total weight of May and\nhis equipment, the low friction did not adequately control his descent.\n                                                    Additionally, it was thought the dynamic\n                                               rope may have contributed to the loss of\n                                               control, as the rope would have stretched\n                                               under load and would have been narrower\n                                               than its stated 10mm.

After finishing the second pitch, Jarek set up a\nbelay at the anchors, belayed his partner up, and then lowered her to the ground,\nwhere she untied and started packing up. He threaded the remaining rope through\nthe anchors and threw it down. He had climbed this route about a month before, so\nhe knew a doubled rope was long enough to make it to the ground. He remembers\nthe rope getting caught on a ledge at the start of the second pitch, but did not pull\nthe rope back up to reset it. His plan was to rappel to the ledge, secure himself to\nthe first-pitch anchors while he made sure the rope reached the ground, and then\nfinish the rappel.\n    Before Jarek reached the ledge, the end of the rope slipped through his rappel device\nand he fell approximately 50 feet, tumbling down the blocky portion at the start of\nthe route. He lost consciousness. Wolfe County Search and Rescue responded to the\nincident and transported Jarek from the crag to an ambulance. He was treated for\nankle, foot, wrist, rib, and scapula fractures and a partially collapsed lung. Jarek was\nnot wearing a helmet. (Sources: Jarek and Wolfe County Search and Rescue.)\n\nANALYSIS\nJarek felt sure that both ends of the rope reached the ledge below the second pitch, so\nhe expected to deal with rope management once he was at that point. Since he never\nmade it to the ledge before the end of the rope fed through his device, he suspects the\nrope was creeping through the anchors as he rappelled, pulling the short end up. (This\n is more likely to occur when doing a rappel with two ropes of different diameters tied\ntogether.) This accident could have been avoided with stopper knots in the ends of\nthe rope. In addition, with a slower descent, Jarek might have been able to identify\nthe shorter strand before it fed through his device. (Source: Jarek.)",

For this route, the climber begins on a ledge approxi-\nmately nine feet above the belayer. They were climbing in\na group of three that day, and the belayer had just finished\nclimbing another route when she came over to give Marty a\ncatch. Marty was already on the ledge and tied in, with the\nroute stick-clipped, so she didn\u2019t see him tie his knot. Before\nclimbing, Marty indicated to his belayer that his knot was\ngood and he was ready to climb. This was his third attempt on\nthe route that day. The belayer reported that during Marty\u2019s\n                                                                A bowline tied with the\nascent he clipped the permadraws on the route and adjusted \u201cYosemite finish.\u201d\nthe rope without any unusual tension or slack.\n   Marty fell at the eighth bolt of the route. The end of the rope pulled through\nthe tie-in points on his harness and he fell approximately 130 feet, landing 50 feet\nbelow the belay station. According to the belayer, she did not feel the expected\nforce from the fall before the rope went slack. The slack rope fell through most of\nthe permadraws and did not have a knot at the end. Marty did not survive the fall.\n   Wolfe County Search and Rescue inspected the rope and the harness, finding\nthem undamaged and in good condition. (Source: Wolfe County Search and Rescue.)\n\nANALYSIS\nAccording to local climbers, Marty typically climbed with a single bowline with a\nYosemite finish (a bowline with the rope\u2019s tail threaded back through the knot).\nSince the belayer was unfamiliar with this knot, she indicated that she was unable\nto check it on earlier climbs that day. It is most likely that Marty did not complete\nhis knot or did not dress it properly\u2014steps that are particularly important with this\nknot\u2014allowing it to become untied.\n    Marty was a beloved member of the local community who regularly volunteered\nto build and maintain trails, developed new climbing routes, supported gear replace-\nment efforts, and coached young climbers at a local recreation center.

After tethering to the anchors with slings, Jason threaded a\n bight of rope through the anchor system, tied a figure-eight on the bight, attached\nthis to his harness with a locking carabiner, and untied his original knot, pulling\nthe tail of the rope through the anchor system. Before detaching his slings from\nthe anchor, Jason had his belayer take out the slack, and he weight-tested the\nsystem. It held, and Jason removed his slings. After indicating to his belayer that\nhe was ready to be lowered, Jason felt a jolt and dropped approximately 60 feet\nto the ground. While falling, Jason remembers positioning his body to land on his\nside instead of his back.\n    Wolfe County Search and Rescue responded to the incident and transported Jason\nfrom the crag to an ambulance. He was ultimately airlifted to UK hospital in Lexing-\nton with a shattered and dislocated right ankle and wrist, a broken right elbow, a\nfractured pelvis, internal bleeding, and a partially collapsed lung.\n    According to other climbers in the area, after the fall, the locking carabiner was\nstill attached to Jason\u2019s harness and the rope dropped to the ground without any\nknot in it. Jason was not wearing a helmet. (Sources: Jason Miller and Wolfe County\nSearch and Rescue.)\n\nANALYSIS\nWhile a definitive cause is unknown, it is possible that Jason did not clip the tied\nbight to his locking carabiner, but instead accidentally clipped another strand of\nrope within the knot. If this is done with an overhand or a figure-eight on a bight, the\nsystem may hold weight temporarily before failing. Consistent vigilance through the\nentire cleaning process is essential. Testing the knot with a bounce and watching it\ntighten before untethering from the anchor can further demonstrate that the knot\nis sufficient. (Sources: Jason Miller and climbers in the area.)",

Since spring in Montana usually means a lot of loose rock from the freeze-\nthaw cycle, I was testing every hold. I was about 10 to 15 feet above my last piece\nof protection, a slung tree, and thumped a half-fridge-size block slightly above my\nhead. I had a gut feeling that it was not totally trustworthy, but hitting it showed\nno movement. I pulled up onto the block and the entire thing crumbled apart,\ncausing a long fall.\n    Luckily, my belayer was attentive and took in slack rapidly, or I would\nhave hit the deck. My shirt and pants were ripped front and back, with a\nsharp stick poking through my shirt in two places. My belayer assisted\nin freeing me from the stick and lowered me safely to the ground.\nSomewhat dazed, but understanding the danger of rockfall, we moved to a safer\narea. My feet, arms, right knee, legs, chest, and left hand were all deeply abraded\n and bloody. As I hobbled over to safety, one\nlast fist-size rock ricocheted off my helmet,\ncracking it but protecting me from injury.\n    Shaking with the rush, I sat down. My\npartner conducted a head to toe assess-\nment. The only other party at the crag came\nuphill to check on me, bringing water to\nwash out my wounds and offering their old\nfirst-aid kit.

Cowen via the northeast ar\u00eate. This route is a prominent granitic\nridge that runs for about 1,000 vertical feet directly to the 11,212-foot summit; it is\nmostly 4th-class terrain with a few 5.6 crux sections. Due to the perceived low risk\nand their plan to solo the route and then walk off the southwest side of the mountain,\nthe three climbers decided not to take gear (rope, harness, or helmets). They did have\na light medical kit, cellphones, a handheld radio, and a Garmin inReach.\n     The day was almost perfectly clear when the group reached the start of the route\nand began climbing. At 10:48 a.m., they were roughly halfway up. Negri was about 30\nfeet in front of the others when he heard a scream from Swanson and saw rockfall,\nincluding a car-size boulder, tumbling into the Strawberry Creek drainage to the\nnorth.

They became disoriented\nwhile attempting to descend in the dark and decided to bivy a few hundred meters\nto the east of the summit and continue in the morning. At sunrise, they began to\nrappel down the north face, and after 12 rappels they reached the Granite Glacier.\nEquipped with only running shoes and one ice axe each, they tried to downclimb the\n50-degree-plus slope of the glacier. After 25 feet, the first climber lost his footing,\nwas unable to self-arrest, and slid about 75 feet before stopping, uninjured, when he\nran into a rock field. His partner fell shortly afterward and also was unable to self-\narrest, sliding about 450 feet into a large rock platform and sustaining lacerations\nand bruising to his ankles. The two climbers activated the SOS function on their\npersonal locator beacon, and Gallatin County Search and Rescue responded within\ntwo hours, short-hauling the injured climber off the mountain.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climbers in this incident made a good decision in delaying their descent, and\nthey were prepared for an overnight stay on the mountain. They had not planned to\ndescend via the glacier, so they did not have the equipment needed to successfully\nnavigate this terrain (crampons or even Microspikes), and their inability to self-arrest\non the icy glacier directly led to the accidents and associated injuries.

Lizzy was reported to be comfortable leading 5.10 sport, but\nwas new to leading traditionally protected routes.\n    According to her partner on the climb, \u201cIt was intended to be a nice and easy,\nmellow cragging day, and we were just starting our warm-up climbs.\u201d Lizzy had\nsuccessfully led a nearby 5.6 trad route and had just followed Avalanche before decid-\ning to attempt the lead.\n    Lizzy placed a small cam (purple Metolius 0) as her first piece and knew that she\nneeded to place something larger. However, her foot slipped before she could get\na larger piece in. As her fall loaded the small cam, the piece popped, throwing her\nsideways. In all, she fell about 10 to 15 feet, landing on a small set of stone stairs and\nsustaining massive damage to her spine. Lizzy was wearing a helmet, which may have\nprevented a fatal injury.\n    The community of climbers at the crag, several of whom had wilderness first\nresponder and first-aid training, quickly got Lizzy stabilized and called for a rescue.\nShe was carried out on a litter and loaded for a helicopter evacuation. She reached\n Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center within two hours of the fall.\n   Lizzy sustained a serious spinal cord injury to her C1\u20132 and T4\u20135 vertebrae and\nno longer has use of her legs.

Small\ncams, especially in less than ideal placements, often will not hold large fall forces. In\nthis case, the uneven terrain below the climb caused a relatively modest fall to have\ncatastrophic consequences.

On a low-angled slab above\nan overhang, and while out of sight to the belayer, George unexpectedly fell.\n    This was Steff\u2019s first time lead belaying, and the instruction she had received\nprior to the climb was that she would feel a strong jerk in the event of a fall. When\nGeorge fell on the slab, the overhang prevented her from seeing him, and because\nof the low angle (and likely some rope drag) his slide pulled up the rope gradually.\nSteff believed George was either tugging on the rope to clip or was climbing quickly\non easy terrain, and so she payed out slack. She continued to do so until he dropped\ninto her field of vision. After a leader fall of about 30 feet, she applied the belay and\nstopped his fall.

The instruc-\ntion Steff received in a climbing gym led her to expect a sharp upward yank with a\nleader fall.

He hit his left side against the wall and landed on the mid-\nheight ledge that separates Retaliation from Upper Refuse.

Responders from Bartlett-Jackson Medical Service, North Conway Fire\nDepartment, and Mountain Rescue Service quickly reached the accident scene by\nway of the summit road. Nearby climbers also came to Goodrich\u2019s aid and were able\nto get the climber into a litter and lower him the remaining 25 feet to the base of the\nclimb.

        "Details_Factors": "\nSandia Mountains, Chimney Canyon\nOn July 13, two men and a woman went to Chimney Canyon in the Sandias, planning\nto rappel the 140-foot route Skinwalker (5.10+) in order to preview gear placements on\nthe climb. The woman went to the base of the crag while the two others went to the top\nand created a three-piece rock anchor in granite, using one number 3 Camalot and two\n Omega Pacific Link Cams that were equalized with a 240cm Dyneema sling. A single\nstatic rope was employed for the rappel, and a Grigri was used as the descent device.\n    They had brought a dog to the top of the crag, and one of the climbers left the\nanchor station to make sure the dog was tied up. As he left the anchor, he looked\nback and saw that his friend, Garon Coriz, 33, was placing a 60-liter backpack under\nthe area of the anchor in an effort to protect the rope and anchor material against\nabrasion. Feeling comfortable that his friend was capable of managing the rappel,\nand that both of them had been confident in the anchor they had set, the climber\nwent to attend to the dog.\n    The woman at the base also left to help with the dog but stated that she saw the\nrappel rope being thrown and that, since it became entangled, it was being pulled\nback up to the top of the cliff at the time she left the base. Approximately 15 minutes\nlater, the climber heard a scream and returned to the anchor, where he saw that all\nof the gear and the rope were gone. Coriz did not survive the 140-foot fall. The acci-\ndent was unwitnessed.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Albuquerque Mountain Rescue team investigated the rope and the anchor\ncomponents, which were found at the bottom of the climb. The Grigri was clipped\nto Coriz\u2019s harness, and the rope was correctly installed in the device for rappelling.\nThe investigators found that the Grigri was approximately eight feet from the anchor\npieces on the ground. (A different report stated this distance was only four feet.) They\nalso found that the Link Cams were damaged and opened wider than their normal\nstopping point, indicating they had pulled out under high force.\n   It is speculated that Coriz may have started the rappel but then returned to the\nanchor for some reason, without pulling rope through the Grigri to take up the eight\nfeet (or four feet) of slack that accumulated. A slip or fall with slack in the rappel rope\ncould cause a fall factor as high as 1. With a static rope, this would generate a very\nsignificant impact force on the anchor.\n   Although all of the cams used in this anchor are designed to resist pulling out\nagainst very high forces, this is only true in good placements in solid rock. In this\ncase, the pack that was positioned under the rope and anchor (presumably to provide\nedge protection) likely shifted the position and vector of pull on one or all of the cams\nimmediately prior to the fall. It\u2019s also possible that the rock around the anchor may\nhave been weaker than it appeared.\n   Once rock anchors have been placed, they should remain in their intended direc-\ntion and should not be used after movement without further inspection and/or\nappropriate readjustment. In addition, static ropes can create high impact forces on\nanchors as well as the climber\u2014they should never be shock loaded. Pre-equalized\nanchors are never truly equalized, and sequential failure of rock anchors can happen.\nLastly, maintain tension in the rope at all times during a rappel (or while standing at\na belay anchor); avoid creating slack that can result in higher than expected impact\nforces in the event of a slip or fall.\n   Dr. Garon Coriz was a physician from Albuquerque and Kewa Pueblo, and was an\nadvocate for Bears Ears National Monument and Native American rights. He will be\ngreatly missed. (Source: James Marc Beverly, Ph.D., IFMGA guide.)",

Eleven accidents required technical\nrescue, including four high-angle rescues. Four uninjured climbers were rescued\nafter becoming stranded, either on rappel or while ascending.\n    One injured climber was attempting to pinkpoint Higher Stannard (5.9) in the\nTrapps after preplacing gear while on rappel. Just below the first-pitch crux, the\nclimber fell. The highest preplaced gear pulled, and the climber fell to the ground.\nThe climber suffered multiple traumatic injuries. This was one of several accidents\nin the Gunks involving gear \u201cfailure\u201d\u2014generally gear pulling out of the rock.\n    On two separate occasions, climbers were rescued when an attempt to rappel\nin the Near Trapps left them stranded. The Fat City rappel (200 feet) requires two\n70-meter ropes to reach the ground. This rappel is notorious for leaving climbers\ndangling in midair when attempting to descend with a single rope. In one of the\nincidents, the climber had no stopper knots below the belay device and less than 10\ninches of rope to hold onto. Mohonk Preserve rangers performed pick-off rescues\nfor each incident and returned the climbers safely to the ground.\n    Another stranding incident began with two climbers attempting to climb Loose\nGoose (5.6) in the Near Trapps. On the second pitch, the leader went off-route and\nwas unable to continue. The leader was approximately 50 feet above and 60 feet\nleft of their second on a small ledge, and struggling with significant rope drag. The\nleader asked the second to secure themself to a tree with a sling and untie from the\nrope system so the leader could descend. However, the leader then realized there\nwere no significant anchor options and became stranded. With darkness arriving,\nclimbers on the ground called 911, and Mohonk rangers rescued the stranded party.\n    Rockfall was involved in one reported climbing accident, and a belayer being\npulled into the wall accounted for another.\n    There were three bouldering accidents that occurred after poor spotting resulted\nin uncontrolled falls. Injuries sustained included fractured lower extremities, lacera-\ntions, and head injuries. At least one bouldering accident resulted from the climber\ncompleting a highball problem (50 feet) and then slipping on the descent.\n\nANALYSIS\nSeveral of these incidents could have been avoided if those involved had the ability to\nself-rescue. In addition, several were caused because climbers did not properly prepare\nfor descents longer than a single-rope rappel. Knowledge of self-rescue and under-\nstanding descent options and requirements by carefully consulting route descriptions\nwould have prevented many of the technical rescues during the past year.

Waterfall holes, glide cracks or crevasses, moats around cliffs and rocks,\nand other deep holes open as the thick snowpack melts. These holes present severe\nterrain traps in the event of a fall. They also can be very difficult to escape or be\nrescued from (and dangerous to rescuers), and with significant amounts of cold water\noften flowing inside, a fall into one of these holes can quickly lead to hypothermia.\nSuch accidents have resulted in several fatalities in Tuckerman Ravine.

We climbed the two pitches of Dinkus Dog to the top, alternating leads.\nWe are both comfortable leading 5.10 trad and had no issues climbing the route.\n     We knew we needed two ropes to rappel from the anchors straight to the ground,\nbut also knew there were convoluted rappel options to get down with one rope. A\ncomment on Mountain Project mentioned a solid tree about halfway up and to the\nleft of the route, and our analysis from the ground confirmed this was a viable option.\n     Once we were at the top, we decided to rappel to the tree and set up a sling\nanchor there to rappel to the ground. As it was a slightly diagonal first rappel to the\ntree, we placed a cam about 20 feet to the left of the anchors as a directional, so the\nrappel line would run straight down to the tree. The plan was that Jed would rappel\nfirst to set up the lower anchor. When it was my turn, I could remove the cam and\nthen follow the diagonal rope to his anchor at the tree. We typically simul-rappel,\nas we are similar in weight, but did not this time. We always tie knots in the ends of\nour rope, use an ATC with an extension, and use a prusik backup. This rappel was\nno exception.\n     While our cam placement made the rappel safer from a directional standpoint,\nit left Jed about three feet short of the tree. I shouted down for him to place a cam\nand anchor himself to it so I could remove the directional up top and thus release\nenough rope for him to safely reach the tree. However, he shouted back that he had\nthe situation under control, as he was able to unweight the rope using a small shelf\nfor his feet. His plan was to extend his belay device with a long sling. However, in\na lapse in judgment, he also removed his prusik and untied the knots from the ends\nof the rope, thinking he would need as much rope as possible to reach the tree. Due\nto the new extension, he couldn\u2019t easily grab the brake strands of the rappel rope. He\napparently either lost his balance or weighted the rappel system expecting the back-\nups he had removed to hold him. The ends of the rope passed through his device, and\nI watched him free-fall more than 100 feet to the ground.\n     I thought that he had died and started screaming, alerting other climbers in the\narea. I also immediately dialed 911 and set a rescue in motion. An amazing community\nof climbers, including an ER nurse who was first on the scene, was able to stabilize\nJed at the bottom. He hit ledges, trees, and brush on the way down and landed on\ndirt as opposed to the slab. He never lost consciousness and recalls \u201cactively falling.\u201d\nHe was wearing a helmet.\n     Once I heard he did not appear to have life-threatening injuries, I pulled up the\nrope and saw the knots we had tied in the ends were no longer there. I lowered one\nend to a climber below, and he tied on a second rope, which I pulled up and then was\n\n able to make a single rappel to the bottom.\nUpon assessing that Jed had no damage to\nhis spine, we carried him from the base of\nthe cliff toward Slick Rock Trail, where we\nmet a rescue team who helped carry him\nthe rest of the way out in a litter. He was\nairlifted to Mission Trauma Center in Ashe-\nville. Miraculously, he sustained only three\nbroken ribs, broken spinous processes, a\nruptured right Achilles tendon, and abra-\nsions down his right side.

It was entirely preventable.\nSimilar accidents can be avoided by never removing these backups and carrying two\nropes where necessary to rappel as opposed to attempting convoluted rappel options.\n[Editor\u2019s Note: An additional consideration is that the climber may have weighted the\nsystem without having his hand on the brake strands of the rappel, trusting his third-\nhand backup to hold him.

Ben and I were familiar with the area, and our plan was\nto introduce Noah and Carson to bouldering outdoors, so we focused on moderate\nproblems. The weather was warm and clear. After climbing one problem, I got on Short\nCrack (V2). The landing area was flat, with no rocks or roots, and we placed several\ncrash pads. Because the problem was short, I decided not to top out. Instead I dropped\nabout four to five feet onto a crash pad, but I landed on the outside of my right foot,\ndislocating the ankle. Ben was able to support my shoulders when I dropped, so my\nhead never hit the pad. I was able to reduce the dislocation and elevate it on a log\nwhile the rest of the group finished a couple more problems, then I walked out slowly.\n    The swelling really kicked in on the drive home.

The first group (A) summited and then hiked out to the\nparking area. Prior to starting, the groups had agreed that if the second group (B) didn\u2019t\nmake it to the parking area by 10 p.m., the first group would go back and look for them.\n    At approximately 6 p.m., while following the last pitch, a male climber (25) fell about\n15 feet onto a pyramid-shaped rock, landing on the back of his right knee and lower\nthigh. He was the last climber in a group of eight students and instructors who had\npreviously topped out. Around 10 p.m., Group A returned to look for the second group,\nand while en route they received a text from Group B reporting that there had been\nan incident with injuries. About the same time, a call was made to Burke County SAR\nindicating that an injured climber was stranded near the top of the Daddy. The over-\nall group leader (who was with Group A) descended to check on the injured climber,\nbefore reascending and making contact with search and rescue.\n    A Burke County SAR member and Burke County EMS Special Ops medic arrived at\nthe informal trail above the Amphitheater and made voice contact with the patient, who\nwas about 90 feet below the top. The rescuers immediately requested further high-\nangle rescue resources. The weather was wet, foggy, and chilly, with a breeze of about\n10 mph. SAR member James Robinson rappelled to the patient and found him partially\ncovered with a plastic poncho and cold and wet. Robinson assisted the climber out\nof his wet layers and into a warming bag with heat packs. A tarp was used for shelter.\n    The climber had sustained a muscular injury to the upper right leg that prevented\nhim from bearing weight. Both rescuer and patient were anchored to the wall and\nspent the remainder of the night on the ledge while resources were assembled. The\npatient\u2019s leg was splinted.\n    In the early morning, rescuers performed a 3:1 hoist, with Robinson ascending a\nfixed line alongside the patient to keep him from impacting the rock face. The injured\nclimber was assisted to the parking area and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe final pitch of the Daddy requires intentional gear placements and an attentive\nbelay to protect the second.

Three guides left to hike in with our clients while another\nguide and I finished setting anchors and dropping ropes. We then needed to rappel\nto the bottom to meet our team. We threaded our last rope and tossed it down but\ncould not see the ends on the ground, and there was no middle marker on the rope.\nI tethered myself to our anchor and began to set up my rappel, extending my rappel\ndevice on nylon webbing and using an autoblock backup. I transitioned to the rappel\nand began to descend.\n    At about 15 feet above the ground, I realized that I had reached the end of one\nstrand of my rappel rope. The barrel knot we had tied as a stopper in this strand had\nrun into my autoblock. I tried to pull myself up off the knot so I could fix the issue.\nIn the process, the knot rolled over itself and became undone. The rope ran through\nmy device, and I fell to the ground and rolled down some rocks. Upon landing, I bit\nmy tongue, suffered multiple abrasions on my legs, and had pain at the top of the\nleft side of my pelvis, but we decided I was well enough to stay and complete my day.\n(Source: Tuesday Kahl.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis site was the third choice for the guided group, and they were in a rush to set\nup top-ropes for their clients. The climbers executed some of the safety steps for a\nrappel, including closing the system with stopper knots and using an autoblock as a\nbackup. The main item they missed was ensuring both rope ends were on the ground.\nIt is possible the rope they were using was shorter than expected, but this alone would\nnot account for the uneven ends. To prevent this, the climbers could have fed both\nends of the rope through the anchor simultaneously until all the rope was out, so they\nwould know the ends were even, despite the lack of a middle mark.\n     The barrel knot should have prevented the climber from rappelling off the end of\nthe rope. (It is unusual for this knot to \u201croll\u201d in the manner described.) It\u2019s possible\nthis stopper knot was not tied snugly enough and/or there was too little tail, leaving\nlittle margin for error as the rappeller worked to separate the knot from her auto-\nblock. \u201cFingers to elbow\u201d is a good way to measure a generous tail of rope below a\nstopper knot.

The beta they\u2019d seen called for using bolted anchors\nat the top of a nearby route to descend. But when Sam\nfinished the fifth-class terrain, he could not find the\nbolts. He scrambled a bit higher to look for the anchor,\nthen continued up more fifth-class to the top of the crag.\nHe decided to set up a top-rope from there and wrapped At the top of Super Bowl\n                                                              Sunday, climbers scramble\na massive boulder with a double cordelette for an anchor,\n                                                              to the right to reach a shared\nthen called to be lowered.

A stopper knot (or tying in the belayer) would have\nkept Sam from hitting the ground.

It was B\u2019s first time climbing in Little Cottonwood\nCanyon, but he had said he was comfortable climbing on granite.\n   Climber B placed his first piece, a number 4 Camalot, about five feet up the route,\nand took a small fall about a foot above that piece. He took a short rest, continued\n climbing, and, in the thin section of the climb, placed a DMM number 7 offset nut\nabout eight feet above his last piece. B continued up and was trying to place a third\npiece of gear, another eight or so feet above the DMM nut, when he fell. The offset\nnut blew out, and although A pulled in some rope as B was falling, the leader dropped\nan estimated 40 feet and hit a ledge about five feet below the belay station.\n    Climber B had a severely dislocated ankle and some back injuries. Climber A tied\noff the fallen climber and gave himself a long leash from the anchor to move down\nto B. Climber B was conscious and alert, and he called 911 for help at about 10:45 a.m.\nClimber A tied a tourniquet around B\u2019s ankle and got on the phone with paramedics\nto guide them to the scene.

        "Details_Factors": "Poor Position, Failure to Heed Danger Signs\nWasatch Range, Santaquin Canyon\nShane and I (both in our 40s and experienced climbers) arrived at the base of the\nSquash Head ice route (WI 3/4) around 9:45 a.m. on February 2. We saw two climbers\nfinishing the first pitch. The avalanche forecast for the day reported the hazard as\n\u201clow\u201d at the climb\u2019s elevation and \u201cmoderate\u201d at middle and upper elevations. Upon\nour arrival, it was encouraging to see the route not dripping and other climbers on\nit. However, the temperatures were already in the mid to upper 30s. Our climbing\nplan would have us down by noon.\n    As Shane led the first pitch, other climbers arrived. I followed Shane\u2019s lead and\nwas on the low-angle ramp above the first steep section when an avalanche funneled\nfrom the gully above the route. The slide passed Shane at the belay, then passed over\nme as I ducked behind an ice bulge. The four or five climbers at the base jumped away\nas one or two feet of snow piled up. After some \u201call safe\u201d communication, I quickly\nfinished the ramp to the anchor. The parties above us had evidently reached the top\nof the second pitch and exited via an alternate rappel toward the route Backoff. The\nparties at the base were mostly packing up to leave.\n    That first slide was at 11 a.m. I met Shane in the belay alcove on climber\u2019s left, both\nof us full of adrenaline. Our discussion is hard to recall, but ultimately we made a nearly\nfatal decision to continue up the second pitch. In retrospect, that was the moment we\nlost control of the day\u2019s outcome. There were four more avalanches to come.\n    Shane and I had climbed this route together seven years prior, and Shane had\nclimbed it since. Before our earlier ascent, we had studied Google Earth and concluded\nthe route was mostly protected from avalanche terrain by a ridge that runs diagonally\nabove. In fact, the route is a funnel from avalanche slopes far up the mountain. During\nour short discussion at the belay, Shane and I concluded the slide had probably origi-\nnated as a wet sluff not far above the route. We figured the sluff had unloaded the\ngully and that another slide was unlikely. In our decision process, we ignored the real\npossibility that the avalanche had originated as a wet slide much higher up.\n    I led the second pitch. Near the top of the steeper ice, another small sluff passed.\nI was within view of the anchor and decided to place my final screw and scramble\nup the gully for 50 feet to the two-bolt anchor. There, I clipped in with my tether\nand set up Shane\u2019s belay on an ATC Guide in autoblock mode. Shane was trailing the\nsecond rope we needed to rappel. With Shane ready to climb, I gave three tugs to\nsignal \u201con belay.\u201d At that moment, I felt a much stronger rumble than the previous\nslides. I looked up the gully and saw a very large avalanche turn into the gully 200\nfeet directly above me. There was nowhere to hide. I thought I was dead.\n    My belay was in the slide path, but to reach the anchor bolts the gully would need\nto fill 10 to 12 feet deep with snow before. After two screams of \u201cavalanche,\u201d fast-\nmoving snow was upon me. Almost gently, I was lifted onto the surface of a river of\nsnow. The gully finally stopped filling just one foot below the bolts. My body was hori-\nzontal, head uphill, held by my PAS tether. I rode on top of the snow river for about a\nminute, and then, as the snow receded, it set me down in the same stance I had occu-\npied a minute earlier. The toe of this slide reached the logging road below the route.\n    Rattled but unhurt, I tugged on the rope to check on Shane. (We could not commu-\nnicate verbally due to the terrain and distance.) I felt three tugs back, but it was quickly\n evident we could not communicate an evacuation plan\nthrough rope tugs. Shane had weathered the slide in the\nfirst belay alcove, getting lightly pummeled by snow.\n    Shane climbed the second pitch quickly. He left most\nof the screws on the route and then clipped into the\nanchor chain. Over the next ten minutes, we were hit by\na fourth and a fifth slide as we planned our escape and\nprepared the rappel. These were smaller but still jostled\nus both strongly. The fourth slide ripped Shane\u2019s trailing\nrope and ATC from gear loops on his harness.\n    We briefly considered finding a safe location and wait-\ning for colder temps to stabilize the snow but worried\nabout remaining exposed in this position. We also consid-\nered the nearby Backoff rappel and ruled it out because\nwe mistakenly believed that rap required two ropes.\n    We decided to tie our 70-meter lead rope to our\nanchor and rappel down a single strand.

Brian Crozier\nWe were able to cut off a 50-foot tail of the lead rope,\ndownclimb the low-angle ramp at the top of the first pitch (somewhat out of the slide\npath), and use a V-thread anchor to descend the final 30-foot curtain to the ground.\n\nANALYSIS\nOur failures this day were related to poor knowledge of the route\u2019s avalanche danger\nand descent options, complacency due to a \u201clow\u201d avy forecast, and improper decision-\nmaking after the danger became evident. We let the excitement of climbing together\nafter years and the good weather cloud our judgment. Lessons learned:\n    (1) Avalanche danger above ice climbs is often not visible.\n    (2) We failed to recognize the initial small wet slides as a precursor to larger, solar-\n        triggered avalanches higher up the mountain.\n    (3) More conservative decision-making was needed after observations of local\n        conditions contradicted the day\u2019s avalanche rating.\n    (4) We should have refreshed our route knowledge. Significant avalanche reports\n        from Squash Head are available online that were not present when we first\n        researched the route years earlier.\n    (5) We didn\u2019t adequately research descent options. We had a poor understanding\n        of the alternate rappel that could have reduced our time in the avalanche zone.\n    (6) Personal radios could have reduced our exposure time by facilitating escape\n        planning after the largest slide hit us, while we were still separated at two\n        belays.

In the days leading up to the climb, we had read route\ndescriptions and the most recent trip reports. As we racked up, I picked out features\non the first pitch that appeared to match the route description. Specifically, I identi-\nfied what I understood to be the \u201csqueeze chimney\u201d up and right of the start.\n    Leading the first pitch, I got to the early ledge and then wrestled through a V-slot/\nsqueeze that felt scrappier than the 5.8/5.9 described. At the top of this squeeze, I\nfound two large fixed nuts with a sling. I clipped my own sling to them and continued\nup. At this point, I could tell I was beginning to trend left of where I should be, but\nthe slot and gear that I had passed led me to believe I was still on route.\n    Above the two nuts, the climbing eased into low fifth class, and I carefully explored\na series of ledges for the correct route. As confusion overcame confidence, I decided\nto stop and build an anchor so David and I could regroup. The first two crack systems\nI evaluated appeared to have some unstable rock. As I continued searching, I placed\nboth hands on the face in front of me and leaned back. A block peeled off in my hands\nand I tumbled backward, falling 25 feet before the fixed nuts and rope caught me.\n    Immediately upon stopping, I saw blood dripping briskly from my pant leg. David\nlowered me to the ground. My left elbow was in excruciating pain. Quickly realizing I\nwould be unable to walk back to the trailhead, David called 911 and guided responders\nto our location. A helicopter arrived, but because I was located in a narrow band of rela-\ntively level ground between a sandstone tower and a steep scree slope, the extraction\nwas complicated. Eventually I was evacuated to Grand Junction, where I was treated\nfor a major laceration on my lower leg and a shattered left elbow.\n\nANALYSIS\nDuring the week preceding the trip, I had been working long hours, totaling 80 hours\nin six days. The morning I finished my last night shift, I immediately jumped on a\nplane from Seattle to Denver without sleeping. The next day we drove to Utah, and we\nheaded up to Sister Superior the following morning. In retrospect, sleep deprivation\nand work-related stress likely contributed to my poor route-finding.\n    There were many clues that I was off route, but I misinterpreted these as signs that\nI was following the route description. Specifically, I should have recognized the two\nnuts as bail gear from someone who had also followed the wrong slot. I also should\nhave corroborated written descriptions with closer attention to photos of the route.\nFinally, I had noted instability in the rock, but was falsely confident because of the\nvery easy climbing in the area where I fell. Given this low-angle terrain, I should have\nbeen more cognizant of the risk inherent in a fall.

She had led the route several times previously.\nThe first bolt, 11 feet off the ground, was stick-clipped. There is a good stance about a\nfoot above the first bolt, and taller climbers are able to make the next clip from here.\nBecause of her height, the climber was unable to reach the second bolt from this stance,\nand as she moved up, her foot slipped. Although her fall was slowed by her belayer, she\nlanded on the ground after swinging under an overhang at the start of the climb. She\nsustained a fractured left calcaneus and a fractured nose.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe area around the second bolt is often the most vulnerable zone of a sport climb\nbecause a slip before making the second clip can result in a ground fall. Stick-clipping\nthe second bolt is sometimes an option. In areas with heavily concentrated routes, bolts\non one climb may be accessed from adjacent routes. (In this case, lowering from the\n5.8+ route beside Axis would have allowed the climbers to hang a quickdraw and/or\nclip the rope at the second bolt before attempting the lead.) A third option is the \u201cstiffy\u201d\nquickdraw, which has a long, rigid dogbone for out-of-reach bolts.

His party of three roped climbers was moving up the\ndry, bare-ice glacier using a 60-meter rope, with approximately 10 meters between\neach climber. The middle climber slipped after turning a corner and fell, pulling the\nlead climber and the trailing climber off their feet.

In late season, glaciers in the Cascades often have a firm\nsnow or hard ice surface, and stopping a slip from becoming a slide is difficult. Protec-\ntion should be considered. The distance between climbers on the rope drastically\naffects the ability to hold a fall. Typically, climbers should stay closer together on\nbare ice or firm conditions.

I was barely able\nto unweight the rope before the core cut. Had I fallen, it would have been a deadly\nfall. We isolated the core shot in a butterfly knot and re-rigged for double-strand\n30-meter rappels. These went well, and we were able to conserve gear. (We had 12\ncams and many rappels remaining.) As we descended, the rock quality deteriorated\nand we had to look harder for anchors.\n    One to two raps before a 3rd-class ramp led to a flat spot on the ridge where\nwe expected to bivy, Weichert built a temporary anchor at a hanging stance, using\na crack that appeared to be between two structural pieces of rock, with a number 1\nand number 0.75 cam. A hard thwack on the more suspect side of the crack (a verti-\ncal column) suggested it was solid, and I inspected the gear before clipping in. We\nboth fully weighted the anchor for several minutes while Skorina rappelled to us.\n    As Weichert and I waited, we decided we could sling the column forming one side\nof the crack (about one square foot on top and 10 feet tall) and use this for a rappel\nanchor if we could clean some debris from the back of the crack. Skorina arrived and\nbegan cleaning the slot as Weichert and I waited, clipped to personal tethers. As Skorina\ncleaned, the column shifted and both cams in the crack released. Weichert and I both\n fell approximately 15 feet into a small gully before tumbling down loose, steep 3rd-class\nterrain for another 50 feet. We slowed and stopped as the ridge flattened and widened.\n     Skorina was able to downclimb to reach us. Both Weichert and I were injured, but\nit was immediately clear that her injuries were more serious than mine. We imme-\ndiately pressed the SOS button on our Garmin inReach and were in contact with\nthe National Park Service in 20 minutes. By this time, it was about 6:45 p.m. and the\nsun was setting, so we prepared for an evening on the ridge; neither Weichert nor I\ncould move over technical terrain with our injuries. However, a Navy helicopter was\nable to rescue us via long line at approximately 9 p.m. (in the dark and with night-\nvision goggles!) and fly us to Seattle. I had a broken left wrist and torn right bicep,\nand Weichert ended up with a concussion and the worst bruises of her life.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe obvious analysis is that a two-piece, one-feature anchor was insufficient. But\nin that situation, we were either going to downclimb steep, chossy 4th-class terrain\nor rappel. The rock looked solid\u2014or at least as solid as anything we\u2019d used already\n(a heuristic trap).\n    The more subtle but important takeaway was our mindset. All three of us are\nworking alpine guides, hot off big seasons crushing easy objectives and looking like\nheroes in front of clients. That obviously will generate some hubris. Add to the mix\nthe fact that Weichert and I were more relaxed on beta and planning than usual\nbecause Skorina was \u201cguiding\u201d us, yet our expectations for planning and risk assess-\nment differed from his, and we should have discussed this as a group.\n    We all had our minds elsewhere as well. I had a high-stakes trip coming up, Skorina\nhad his advanced alpine course, and Weichert was joining a new company. None of us\ntotally had our head in the game. The final, and perhaps most interesting, issue was\nthat the AMGA had used this route for an advanced alpine course two weeks before\nwe got there. Every time the rock quality deteriorated or the climbing got worse, we\nlooked at each other and shrugged, saying, \u201cThe AMGA uses this route.\u201d This \u201cAMGA\nstamp of approval\u201d created a bizarre expert halo. [Editor\u2019s Note: It\u2019s not unusual for\nguides to belay two clients on a single rope, and these climbers were in the middle of an\nextended traverse and thus trying to save weight. However, doing alpine routes with\ntwo ropes will greatly speed an unplanned retreat and provide access to many more\nanchor options.] (Source: Spencer Dillon.)",

        "Details_Factors": "\nMt. Rainier, Liberty Ridge\nAt about 8:30 p.m. on May 29, a climber called 911 to report a large rockfall around\n10,800 feet at Thumb Rock, high camp for the Liberty Ridge route. The climber\nrelayed to dispatchers that Arleigh William \u201cBill\u201d Dean (46) had been killed and two\nother climbers were seriously injured by the rockfall. Weather and the late hour kept\nrescuers from conducting a rescue until the next day.\n    The injured and deceased were members of three separate teams attempting\nLiberty Ridge. The first team arrived at Thumb Rock around noon. Dean\u2019s team followed\nat about 2 p.m. The last group showed up at 3 p.m. They spaced their three tents three\nto four feet vertically from each other on a slope, with Dean\u2019s tent in the middle. The\nafternoon was hot, with slushy snow, sliding snow, and multiple rockfall incidents.\nAll six climbers were inside their tents when the rockfall occurred just before sunset.\n    A climber in the lowest tent said he was listening to music but had left one earbud\nout to listen for rockfall. He\u2019d even joked about wearing a helmet to bed. As the sun\nwaned, he heard yelling and felt rocks graze his back and neck. Dean\u2019s tent was\npushed partially on top of the lowest tent. The uninjured climbers exited their tents\nand began to treat those who were hurt. One climber called 911, and another hit the\nSOS button on his Garmin device. After learning rescuers would not be coming that\nnight, they wrapped the injured climbers to keep them warm and stayed awake to\nwatch for more rockfall.\n    The next morning, low clouds complicated the rescue operation. A helicopter\nairlifted the first injured climber around 12:30 p.m., transporting him to Harborview\nMedical Center in Seattle. The next climber was lifted from the scene about 2:10 p.m.\nJust before 3 p.m., Dean\u2019s body was flown off the mountain. The uninjured climb-\ners began descending from Thumb Rock around 11:15 a.m. and were evacuated from\nthe Carbon Glacier at about 4:30 that afternoon. (Source: Mt. Rainier National Park\nincident report.)\n\nANALYSIS\nThis route is known to be committing, with rockfall and falling ice quite common.\n(See \u201cDanger Zones: Mt. Rainier\u201d in ANAC 2014.) In May 2014, six climbers were\nswept to their deaths from the ridge while sleeping, presumably by rockfall or a\nsnow slide. Although it\u2019s difficult to protect against rockfall at Thumb Rock, it\u2019s\nsometimes possible to build or enhance protective walls around tents. Weather also\n played a role in this accident. The\nclimbers reported slushy condi-\ntions and rockfall, and the snow\nhadn\u2019t frozen the night before.\nThe park service recommends\nagainst attempting Liberty Ridge\nif the freezing level on Mt. Rainier\nis above 14,000 feet. Very strong\nclimbers with good climbing\nconditions may consider camping\nat Curtis Ridge and then approach-\ning and climbing Liberty Ridge in a\nsingle day (normally two days for\nmost climbers), thus minimizing Thumb Rock area showing (A) rockfall impact craters in\nthe exposure to falling rock and hard snow and (B) tent site where climbers were hit on the\nice.

Three days later, Yevgeniy Krasnitskiy (39), Ruslan Khasbulatov (33),\nVasily Aushev (35), and Constantine Toporov (37) called 911 to report they were\nstranded at 13,500 feet, still about 600 feet below Liberty Cap, due to high wind and\none of the men suffering from altitude sickness and exhaustion. Rangers attempted\nto reach the men with a park helicopter three times on June 3 and 4. A Chinook heli-\ncopter from Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma also responded, but clouds and\nwind up to 50 mph stopped all the rescue attempts.\n    The wind had destroyed the climbers\u2019 tent, and they had lost a pack with gear\nand food. Rescuers attempted to drop supplies, but the men were unable to reach\nthem. By June 5, the weather had worsened on the upper mountain, preventing aerial\noperations. However, the four men were able to climb about half a mile from their\nprevious location, reaching a point near Liberty Cap that was much less affected by\nthe wind. In a brief window of good weather on the morning of June 6, the park heli-\ncopter landed near the stranded climbers and flew them out in two groups.

These climbers had heard about\na rockfall fatality on Liberty Ridge two days before they started (see report above), so\nthey chose not to camp at the usual Thumb Rock site and instead pushed higher. That\nlast-minute decision contributed to their fatigue and positioned them in a very exposed\nspot when bad weather moved in.

They had chosen to simul-rappel but did not know they needed\ntwo 70-meter ropes to complete the full rappel (or two 60-meter ropes if using an\nintermediate station).\n    They unknowingly rappelled past the intermediate station to just above the roof\non the second pitch of Pleasant Overhangs (5.7) and did not have the technical ability\nto ascend their ropes to regain the station. They were able to move to a stance, and\nanother party nearby attempted to assist them by suggesting they climb the second\npitch of Pleasant Overhangs and rappel from there. The climbers were unsure about\ntheir ability to climb the second pitch, and after seeing a bolt on the nearby Pleas-\nant Exposure (5.7 sport), they decided to continue their descent using it. They then\nrigged a second rappel from a carabiner on the single bolt.\n    At approximately 2:15 p.m., they began simul-rappelling again, with the older\nclimber descending much faster than the younger climber before losing control\nfor unknown reasons and rappelling off his end of the rope. Since they were simul-\nrappelling, his fall unweighted the counter-balance and, according to two eyewit-\nness accounts, the younger climber then fell approximately 100 feet to the ground.\nThe younger climber impacted the top edge of a very steep dirt slope, collapsing the\nslope and tumbled an additional 30 feet.\n    Nearby climbers and local guides responded immediately. Guides contacted\nemergency services and, based on the length of the fall, requested a helicopter for\nevacuation. The younger climber never lost consciousness after the fall and suffered\ninjuries to his left wrist, left femur, and right foot. Additionally, he had multiple lacera-\ntions and abrasions. Rescuers maintained spinal precautions as they placed him in a\nlitter and utilized numerous low-angle rappels to reach Roy Gap Road and a waiting\nambulance. The older climber, having fallen only ten feet, had no obvious injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis accident was the result of multiple and compounded errors, beginning with a\nlack of familiarity with the descent options at Seneca. Reading the guidebook and\nknowing the required rope length and locations of descent anchors would have given\nthe climbers safer options.\n     Simul-rappelling is an advanced technique and requires careful execution. There are\nseveral ways to close the system and prevent a climber who loses control from break-\ning the essential counter-balance. These include tying knots at the ends of the rope,\nfriction hitch (third hand) backups, and a tether between the climbers, allowing one\nclimber to stop and control the other\u2019s descent in the event that one of the climbers\nloses control of the brake strand.\n     Finally, tunnel vision while in a stressful situation is extraordinarily difficult to\nself-identify, and other climbers are often in a position to spot an unseen problem.\nIf, as happened here, another party offers suggestions, take this as an opportunity\nto stop and reexamine your system and plan.

        "Details_Factors": "Uneven Ropes, Haste, No Stopper Knots\nYellowstone National Park, Mammoth Hot Springs, Hoodoos Area\nMy significant other/climbing partner and I (male, age 20) had spent most of August\n6 sightseeing around Yellowstone. After seven hours of driving, I got antsy and\nchecked Mountain Project to see if there were any climbs nearby. I found a 5.5 and\n5.9 in the Hoodoos area, near Mammoth Hot Springs, that were easy to top-rope\nand had a short approach.\n    My partner and I scrambled up the backside of the crag to check it out. The anchor\nwas odd, with a few chopped bolts, a single homemade bolt ten feet down the face,\nand a small dying tree. We scrambled down to the car and I racked up. Despite having\na helmet, I consciously decided not to grab it because, after looking at the route, I\nthought, \u201cYa know, if I fall from the top while setting up this top-rope, a helmet isn\u2019t\ngoing to help.\u201d I climbed back up and constructed a monster anchor consisting of five\ncams and the trunk of the not-so-great tree. I think the rock is volcanic tuff, and it\nfelt a bit soft, so I wanted as many pieces as I could get, even for a top-rope.\n    After the anchor was set up, I pulled out our 70-meter rope and dropped it onto\nthe ledge at my feet. Two days prior to this trip, I had been on the Diamond in Colo-\nrado, and I was confident that we had center-coiled it before hiking off Longs Peak. It\nwas pretty tangled, but I knew that Mountain Project had listed one of the routes as\n25 feet in height, and even though this route obviously was taller than that, I assumed\nboth sides of my rope would reach the ground.\n    I clipped a bight into the master point and tossed off the rope. I heard it hit and\nsaw portions of it on the ground. The climb is vertical down low, which made it hard\nto see both strands running all the way to the ground. But I assumed both ends were\ndown, since I believed I had grabbed the rope near the center. The route was so short\nthat I failed to tie safety knots in the ends.\n    I clipped in my ATC, attached a klemheist backup, and, after weighting my system,\nunclipped my PAS and started backing off. I rappelled somewhere around 15 feet before\nstopping to admire an interesting horizontal slot; I thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s going to be\nfun to use,\u201d and then continued rappelling. Almost immediately, I went weightless and\ntipped backward, falling about 26 feet. I impacted the ground with the heel of my right\nfoot before landing hard on my right wrist and hand. Blood gushed from my right wrist,\nand my right shoe was mostly ripped off, but I was alert and awake.\n    I yelled for my partner, and she ran to get a first-aid kit from the car as I held pres-\nsure on my wrist. She then did a quick, focused spine assessment before address-\ning my other injuries. After trying to close the laceration on my wrist with butterfly\nbandages, I moved to the car and we drove to the park medical clinic, luckily only\nten minutes away. Unluckily, it had closed 45 minutes earlier. The nearest ER was 60\nmiles to the north in Livingston, Montana. An hour and 20 minutes later, we pulled\nup to the entrance. My injuries included a sprained ankle, a sprained right wrist, a\nlacerated right hand, abrasions covering large portions of my back, and contusions\non my elbow, head, and right heel.\n\n ANALYSIS\nThe most obvious way to prevent this accident would have been making sure the\nrope was placed into the anchor\u2019s master point exactly at the middle. I also could\nhave tied knots in the ends of the rope, I could have watched the rope carefully as\nI backed off the anchor to see if both strands were going all the way to the ground,\nand I could have asked my partner, who was waiting around the corner in the shade,\nif both sides were on the ground. I also could have worn a helmet, which would have\nprevented one of my various injuries. Slowing down and paying more attention to\ndetail would have prevented this accident. (Source: Anonymous.)",

(Source: Grand Teton National Park\nSearch and Rescue Report.)\n\nANALYSIS\nMoats are the crevasse-like slots that form between steep alpine snowfields and\nadjacent rock walls. They are serious hazards to climbers or skiers falling from above\nor, as in this case, trying to transition from snow to rock or vice-versa. Because\nrock walls frequently angle underneath a snowpack, a climber or skier may slide far\n underneath the snow and be trapped. Rescue can be more difficult than from a similar\ndepth of crevasse. In this case, the climber was alone and thus had little chance of\noutside help. He was fortunate he was able to escape before dangerously weakening\nfrom hypothermia and his injuries.

Rangers were immediately\nsummoned to the Lupine Meadows Rescue Cache, as was the park\u2019s contract heli-\ncopter. At about 6:40 p.m., helicopter 35HX departed from the rescue cache with\nrangers P. Edmonds and K. Kreis onboard. They located the party west of the base of\nthe Ellingwood Couloir on the Middle Teton; however, they encountered very strong\nwinds and were unable to land.\n    Information from other climbers in the area indicated the injured person had\nfallen and hit some rocks near the saddle between Middle and South Tetons. She\nfelt that she had broken her leg, but there were no life-threatening injuries and no\nobvious bleeding. Four members of her original group of 11 were with her, and they\nhad helped her descend a short distance to the current location near the base of the\nEllingwood. She felt that she could not continue down.\n    Because of the high winds, a ground operation was initiated. At 7:50 p.m., rangers\nG.R. Fletcher and V. Zeilman were dispatched from the Lower Saddle, where they\nwere on patrol. They climbed over the Middle Teton and descended to her location\nvia the Southwest Couloir. Rangers R. Schuster and P. Edmonds were dispatched\nfrom the rescue cache in the valley.\n    Both parties of rangers reached the patient at about 11 p.m. Ranger Schuster\ninterviewed her and learned that after a successful ascent of the Middle Teton\nby the Southwest Couloir route, she had slipped on snow and slid about 100 feet\ninto rocks, hitting her head and injuring her left lower leg. Schuster confirmed a\npossible broken leg. Additionally, he found several contusions on her legs and arms\nwith no bleeding.\n    Two rangers stayed with her through the night, providing overnight gear and\nmedical support, while rangers Fletcher and Zeilman short-roped her four compan-\nions down steep snow, rock, and ice to Garnet Meadows and then to the Lupine\nMeadows parking lot, arriving about 6:30 a.m. Six additional members of her group\nhad previously descended to the parking area and were waiting there.\n    At 8 a.m. on July 18, the helicopter tried again to extract the patient, but the wind\nwas again too high. Four additional rangers were then sent to her location from the\nvalley with a snow-lowering litter, and the six rangers now on the scene lowered\nand carried the patient to Garnet Meadows in the litter, arriving about 1 p.m. Six trail\ncrew members with a wheeled litter had been dispatched to the Meadows to assist\nin a carry-out from there. However, the wind briefly calmed, and at about 2 p.m.,\nthe helicopter was able to land, pick up the injured patient, and fly her to the rescue\ncache, where she was loaded into the park ambulance. (Source: Grand Teton National\nPark Search and Rescue Report.)\n\n\n ANALYSIS\nThis large group was comprised of members of a foreign alpine club. They were poorly\nprepared even for a moderate mountain route like the Southwest Couloir. The group\ndid not have enough ice axes or crampons for everyone, nor appropriate footwear\nor clothing for the conditions. (There often is extensive snow travel on this route in\nmid-July.) The less experienced members were not partnered or accompanied by\nexperienced mountaineers. The Southwest Couloir is a route where a grade (3rd class)\nor description (it is often called a \u201chike\u201d online) fails to convey the seriousness of a\nremote alpine climb.

As he attempted to descend a gully above the Northwest Ice\nCouloir, he slipped on wet rock and slid about 80 feet before catching himself.

After a few unsuccessful attempts at descending, she committed\nto a route in a general southwest direction. During the descent, she got off route in\nsteep, loose terrain and eventually slipped on snow, slightly injuring her hands. She\nstopped on a small, exposed ledge and called 911 to request help.\n    She was not able to report her location accurately, and cell phone coordinates\nwere inconsistent and unreliable. At 9:15 p.m., rangers Ronczkowski and Pearson\nleft Lupine Meadows trailhead to attempt to locate the stranded climber and assist\nher down. At 12:34 a.m., the rangers made voice contact with her from the upper\nSouth Fork of Garnet Canyon, but due to faint calls and echoing canyon walls, they\nfound it difficult to locate her position. Finally, at 2:47 a.m., the rangers located the\nheadlamp of the stranded climber high on the peak in the South Couloir (well to\nclimber\u2019s right of the Southwest Couloir). They attempted to climb the couloir to\nreach to her but determined it to be too dangerous in the dark. They decided to\nclimb the Southwest Couloir to the summit and attempt to downclimb to her loca-\ntion. At 4:41 a.m., they reached the summit and soon decided to rest there and wait\nfor first light to continue.\n    Over the next several hours, the rangers attempted to descend to the stranded\nclimber\u2019s position and another team of rangers attempted to reach her by helicop-\nter. At 8:14 a.m., following a reconnaissance flight, ranger Johnson was short-hauled\ninto the climber\u2019s location from the helicopter. However, soon after Johnson was\non scene, rain and snow showers moved into the area, delaying any further flights.\n    By early afternoon, after several unsuccessful helicopter extraction attempts in\nvery poor weather conditions, rescuers were in position to begin a technical raise\nof the patient toward the summit of the Middle Teton. The first raise of Johnson and\nthe patient was completed at about 1:15 p.m.\n    A small break in the weather could be seen coming shortly after 2 p.m., so the\nteam again prepared for a short-haul extraction. After one false start due to icing\n conditions, ranger Johnson and the patient were successfully extracted at about 3\np.m. and delivered to Lupine Meadows, where she was treated for hypothermia and\ndehydration.

Teton rangers encourage climbers to\nstick together\u2014two heads are often better than one for route-finding decisions.\nIn addition, she had left the trailhead at 8 a.m. and reached the summit late in the\nafternoon during the relatively short days of September\u2014the pressure of oncom-\ning nightfall may have contributed to her decision-making.

The caller\nwas a solo climber making a traverse from the South Teton to Nez Perce. The\ninjured man had been roped to two partners doing the same traverse. On Gilkey\nTower, the solo climber was above the other group when a ledge he was standing\non broke loose. The subsequent rockfall raked the three climbers below. Two of\nthe partners managed to dodge the rocks, but a watermelon-size rock struck the\n38-year-old man. The force of the impact knocked him off his stance, and he slid\napproximately 10 feet before being caught on belay by one of his partners. The solo\nclimber descended to the injured man and helped assess his injuries, which included\ncontusions, abrasions, and a large hematoma on his thigh. They determined that\nhe needed a rescue.\n    At about 1:10 p.m., after a reconnaissance flight, ranger K. Kreis was short-hauled\nto the accident site. He assessed the injured climber and confirmed a short-haul\nextraction was warranted, and at 1:45 p.m., after splinting the injured leg for the\nshort-haul, he and the injured man were extracted from Gilkey Tower and brought\nto Lupine Meadows.

I had not climbed the route before.\n    For soloing, I use a Kong Duck mini-ascender with a paracord sling around my\nneck to keep the device high on the fixed rope, prevent it from weighting the rope\ndynamically, and to keep it separate from my Petzl Microtraxion, which I use below\nthe Duck as a backup. I placed both devices on the rope and tested that they were\nengaging properly. I was about to start climbing when I realized I had forgotten my\ncrack gloves. I unclipped both devices from my harness and removed the paracord\nsling from my neck, leaving both devices attached to the rope, and walked over to my\npack to get my gloves. Then I clipped back into the devices and put the sling around\nmy neck. I did not recheck my system.\n    The route has a classic Vedauwoo start\u2014the base of rock is overhung for the\nfirst ten feet or so. I struggled with the climbing, and I was fighting to keep the\nrope out of the crack where I was trying to jam. I probably weighted my system\nthree or four times. At some point, I noticed the Kong Duck had slipped down\nthe rope and was right on top of the Microtraxion, instead of higher on the rope\nas it should be.\n    I tried to correct this by holding onto the rope above the devices, so I could\nunweight them and try to get the system working properly. I pulled the Duck up the\nrope, then disengaged the cam on the Microtraxion and slid it back down the rope.\nWhen I reweighted the system, I fell about ten feet. My hand was on the rope, so I slid\nfairly slowly and received a minor rope burn, but was otherwise uninjured.\n    At the base of the route, I saw that the paracord had gotten tangled in the Duck,\ndisabling its cam. It took me a few weeks to figure out why the Microtraxion had not\nheld my weight (the Microtraxion was properly rigged). I am fairly certain that after I\ndisengaged the cam on the Microtraxion, the disabled Duck slid back down the rope\nand held the Microtraxion open, so that neither device engaged.\n\nANALYSIS\nComplacency and haste were the major factors in this accident. I had probably top-\nrope soloed around 50 to 60 pitches in Vedauwoo that summer and felt comfortable\nwith the system, but was in a hurry to get some climbing in after work and failed to\nrecheck my system when I clipped back into it.\n    I should have realized that my Duck was disabled and certainly not messed with\nboth devices at the same time. Sometimes I tie backup knots in my rope, but in this\nsituation I was so close to the ground that I didn\u2019t really have a chance to tie backups\nyet. Some people fix two separate lines and place one device on each line; this would\nhave prevented my accident, but I find that with crack climbing, keeping one rope\nout of the crack is hard enough.\n    This accident was very minor, and I only share it because it could have been very\nserious under different circumstances. When climbing alone, it is important to always\ndouble-check your systems. (Source: Anonymous and the Editors.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nBritish Columbia, Squamish, Smoke Bluffs\nOn July 10, a climber was demonstrating a roped solo system to a friend while leading\nthe route Libya Sucks (5.7). The climber was using a Grigri as his self-belay device. He\nplaced a few pieces of protection low on the route, then stood up at a good stance and\nplaced his next piece (a cam, size unknown) at chest height. He clipped the lead rope to\nthis cam, then attempted to demonstrate that he could rest (\u201ctake\u201d) on the rope using\nhis self-belay. However, the piece pulled out, and his earlier protection was too low\nto keep him from hitting the ground. He landed on his back and broke one vertebra.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe climber attributed the cam failure to the fact that the direction of pull on the\npiece was different than anticipated; he had placed and tested the cam in anticipation\nof a fall from above, but when he weighted it at the stance, the pull was outward. He\nalso acknowledged it was a \u201cpoor placement.\u201d A general lesson from this incident is to\nback up a marginal piece if it is the only thing keeping you from hitting the ground or\na ledge in the event of a fall.

This highly\nexperienced climber, with 5.13 trad routes under his belt, had free-soloed this route\npreviously.

        "Incident_Type": "BELAYER PULLED INTO ROCK",
        "Details_Factors": "Poor Position\nBritish Columbia, Skaha Bluffs, Plum Wall\nOn March 23, my climbing partner and I were finishing our day of climbing on a 5.9\nsport route called Sagging Bumline. It was a sunny day, we felt rested, and the climb\nwas well within our limits. This is a 35-meter sport climb, and we were using a brand-\nnew 70-meter rope. I was belaying my partner with an ATC. We were both wearing\nhelmets, and I had approach shoes on.\n    Sagging Bumline is the sister climb to the very popular Plum Line (5.9) just to its\nleft. Plum Line is notorious for accidents due to the length of the climb (35 meters),\nand various climbers have rappelled off the ends of their ropes or dropped their\nsecond. Therefore, a rappel station was added at a ledge approximately eight meters\noff the ground, reached by scrambling. This station allows climbers with a 60-meter\nrope to complete a second rappel or scramble to the ground. This ledge is also where\nyou clip the first bolt of Sagging Bumline.\n    Below the ledge and slightly to the right is a large alcove or cave feature, which\nis directly under the first bolt of Sagging Bumline. We recognized that there was a\nrisk of the belayer being pulled into the roof of the cave should the leader fall, and\nwe decided to stand farther left under the first bolt of Plum Line.\n    We completed our safety check, and the leader cleanly led the first 30 meters of\nthe route to the final bolt and crux move. He attempted to make the final clip but\ndropped the rope. As I began pulling in extra rope and trying to move into a squatting\nposition to brace for a potential fall, the leader fell off. I was pulled off the ground\napproximately seven or eight meters, swung to the right toward the first bolt, and\npulled into the wall. I bent my knees and put my feet up to brace for impact against\nthe wall, but I was rotating slightly so my left foot made contact first. I heard a very\nloud cracking sound and knew I had broken my left leg.\n    As I hung off the ground, I maintained control of the brake rope and the lead\nclimber hanging above. I began to call for help, and two climbers ran over to assist. I\nexplained I had broken my leg and still had my lead climber on belay. I lowered myself\nto the ground, where the assisting party was able to enter the system and remove me\nsafely. They then lowered the lead climber to the ground without incident.\n    One climber made cell phone contact with 911 and Penticton SAR while others\nsplinted and elevated my broken left leg, and kept\nme warm and calm while the rescue team was\nassembled. A ground team from Penticton SAR\nattended the scene first. Due to the steep access\nand snow on the ground, the team decided that\na helicopter lift would be the safest extraction\nmethod. At Penticton Hospital, I underwent\nsurgery the next morning for a mid-shaft trans-\nverse tibia/fibula fracture. I was discharged four\ndays later, and I am back climbing today.\nAccident scene at Skaha Bluffs. SBL is the Sagging\nBumline route. Yellow dot marks the belayer\u2019s position\nbelow the adjacent Plum Line. Hans Bauck\n ANALYSIS\nBelayer positioning and a substantial weight difference between the leader and\nbelayer were the main factors in this accident. I did not want to be under that roof\nif my partner fell, so I decided to stand farther left. Unfortunately, this meant there\nwas a lot of extra rope out and I was pulled up and into a swing by the leader\u2019s fall. I\nstill feel it was the right decision to stand further left because I might have broken\nmy neck by hitting the roof instead.\n     A ground anchor might have prevented the dangerous swing. There were no good\nopportunities to build an anchor in the rock at the base, though a small tree nearby\nmight have withstood the force of the swing. The other option would have been to\nscramble up to the ledge and tie into the intermediate anchor at the rappel station\nin order to belay the leader.\n     My climbing partner is 45 pounds heavier than I am, which is right on the limit\nof what is considered safe. To compensate for this, we could have used the Edelrid\nOhm, which is clipped to the first bolt of sport climbs and reduces the force on the\nbelayer. Prior to the leader falling, I was in the midst of pulling in extra slack, and I was\nnot bracing in my harness, ready to catch him. I have caught him many times when\nI was better positioned, and I have never been pulled so far up or with such force.\n     I was using an ATC-style device to belay. Had I lost control of my brake hand, the\nleader would have fallen 30 meters. Since the accident, we have purchased a Petzl\nGrigri, an assisted-braking device that lowers the chances of dropping the lead\nclimber in this type of incident. I also recommend wearing a helmet while belaying.\nIf I had hit my head instead of my leg, I might have been knocked unconscious and\ndropped the leader. (Source: Allison Beynon.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Sling Untied, Inexperience\nBritish Columbia, Valhalla Provincial Park, Niselheim\nOn July 27, my climbing partner (female, 25) and I (male, 31) climbed the east ridge of\nNiselheim and then began descending the fourth-class northwest ridge. As we were\nscrambling down the ridge, my partner found a rappel anchor consisting of a single\npiece of webbing around a good horn with two carabiners attached. The webbing\nlooked new and in good condition, and we assumed someone had recently rappelled\nfrom it. I flaked the rope and handed it to my partner. She passed the rope through\nthe two carabiners and began to rappel.\n    The anchor sling came undone immediately under her weight, and my partner\nfell approximately five meters on slabby rock. I quickly scrambled down to meet her.\nWe checked for injuries, and luckily she only had minor cuts on her right hand and a\nbruise on her right hip. I collected the rope, the webbing anchor, and the two cara-\nbiners. The sling had come untied during the rappel. I found the webbing with an\noverhand knot in each end of it.\n\nANALYSIS\nI could not see the knot before my partner began to rappel, because she was blocking\nmy view. My partner has never tied webbing and was unfamiliar with a water knot,\nused to join the ends of webbing. When inspecting sling anchors, it is important to\n evaluate not only the quality of the material but also the knots. When in doubt, double\nup the anchor with a fresh sling. Just because a previous party has rappelled off an\nanchor does not mean it\u2019s safe. (Source: Anonymous climber.)\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The person who left this\nanchor likely was attempting to tie a water\nknot or single fisherman\u2019s knot but instead\nsimply threaded the tail of one overhand\nknot through the body of the overhand at the\nother end of the sling. If someone rappelled\noff this anchor prior to this accident, all that\nheld the webbing in place was the pressure\nof the loaded sling against the horn, with the\ntail end of the webbing squeezed by the single\noverhand. The tail would have gradually\nworked loose or slipped free as pressure was\nreleased.

In many cases, careful scrambling or\na quick belay is a more efficient way to descend short steps than rappelling, and often\nsafer than relying on anchors of unknown provenance.

Stephen, Massey\u2019s\nOn Monday, March 11, a guided party of six climbers, consisting of two guides and\nfour clients, climbed Massey\u2019s, the popular WI4 ice route near Field. This was the\nsecond day of a four-day waterfall ice climbing camp. On the previous day, the group\nhad climbed at Haffner Creek.\n    Climbing as two roped teams, they ascended four pitches to the top of Massey\u2019s\nand then rappelled back to the base. Prior to leaving the area, the group gathered\nfor a lesson on V-thread ice anchors. Just before 3 p.m., while they were standing\nat the base of the climb, a large, fast-moving avalanche that started high overhead\nran down the climb and caught all of the climbers. Two were buried, one completely\nand another with her head and arm barely exposed. The climbers\u2019 packs, which were\nsitting on the ground nearby, were swept away and buried.\n    The guides immediately began searching. After determining that the partially\nburied victim was uninjured, they left her in place and concentrated on finding the\nmissing person. Within two minutes, they had located her using an avalanche trans-\nceiver. She was buried under approximately 1.8 meters of snow. However, the guides\nwere unable to dig effectively because all of their shovels and probes had been buried\nwith the missing packs. Instead, they dug frantically with crampons and helmets.\n    The initiation of the avalanche had been witnessed by another guide from the\nsame climbing camp who was near the parking lot.

The snowpack had weakened considerably over this time and\nwas comprised mostly of faceted grains with very little strength. The snowpack was\nat a tipping point where new snow and variable wind or temperature could change\nthings immediately.\n    Parks Canada\u2019s avalanche bulletin for Monday, March 11, rated the avalanche\ndanger as moderate in alpine areas and low at the treeline and below. The bulletin\nwarned that the alpine and treeline avalanche danger would increase on Tuesday,\nMarch 12, \u201cwith the arrival of new snow and strong alpine winds Monday night.\u201d\n    The wind arrived early, ahead of the snow. Parks Canada\u2019s Bosworth Upper\nweather station, located 10 kilometers northeast of Massey\u2019s at an altitude of 2,745\nmeters, showed steadily increasing winds starting Sunday afternoon and reaching\npeak gusts of 98 kph (61 mph) by 10 a.m. on Monday (see chart). This wind combined\nwith 20 centimeters of new snow from three days prior to produce significant wind\nloading in alpine areas overnight on Sunday and throughout the day on Monday.\nDuring this time, the alpine temperatures remained cold, rising from -17\u00b0C on Sunday\nmorning to -11\u00b0C at the time of the incident on Monday.\n     The wind loading on March 11 overloaded the weak snowpack above Massey\u2019s, and\na large natural avalanche released at approximately 2,500 meters above sea level. The\navalanche traveled a linear distance of 1,500 meters, running over the climb (which\nis located below treeline), and stopped in the run-out zone below.\n    The climbers had grouped closely together for the V-thread lesson at the base of\nthe climb when they were impacted by the avalanche. Despite receiving a warning\nphone call, the group had no time to react before they were struck. They had carried\navalanche rescue equipment, but it was buried or swept away with their packs when\nthe avalanche hit. (Source: Grant Statham/Parks Canada.)",

Although\ninitially unconscious, the second climber quickly regained his senses. (His helmet,\nwhich had been badly damaged during the avalanche, had likely saved his life.)\nAlthough suffering a broken ankle and a lacerated chest from his partner\u2019s cram-\npons during the avalanche, the first climber was able to move his injured partner to\na position that was less exposed to the danger of serac fall and provide information\nto rescuers. A rescue team responded, recovering all three climbers.\n\nANALYSIS\nAn unusually wet and cold summer had contributed to a lingering and unstable snow-\npack at the time of the accident. Precipitation gauges at Job Creek and Southesk\nshowed that 25 to 38 mm fell between July 14 and July 20, with around 12 mm falling\non July 19, the day before this incident. Furthermore, after cool temperatures on July\n19 (and associated snowfall in the alpine), the freezing level spiked upward on July 20.\n    The Public Avalanche Bulletin for Jasper National Park issued May 13, 2019, which\nwas valid until further notice, warned of spring conditions and stated, \u201cTraveling\nearly in the day is recommended, as conditions can change rapidly in short periods\nof time due to daytime warming\u201d and \u201cWhen the sun comes out, temperatures soar\nabove freezing, or rain falls, expect wet loose avalanches and cornice failures. This\nis especially relevant in steep, high-consequence terrain, such as gully climbs\u2026.\u201d\n    The climbers\u2019 late arrival at their bivy and their fatigue once there resulted in a late\nstart. The warm overnight temperatures and cloudy skies had not produced the desired\novernight freeze. These factors contributed to the increased avalanche danger on the\nday of the accident, and their exposure increased as the day warmed up. One of the\ntrio, it appears, had come to this conclusion but was unable to deter her companions.\n    The group was not carrying avalanche beacons, shovels, or probes. However, all\nthe group members carried good communication tools, which resulted in rapid and\neffective notification of Jasper\u2019s rescue team.

Jess\u2019 iPhone was found on him at the base of the face.\nThe phone provided exact time, altitude, and GPS locations from each of his photos,\nwhich not only proved they made the summit of the 3,295-meter peak, but also gave\nclues to the location of their route, a substantial new variation of the climb M-16,\nand the nature of their accident.\n    On my second trip (of three) to the accident site, on June 2, we found David Lama\u2019s\nGoPro and Hansj\u00f6rg Auer\u2019s camera, both with informative photos. Using Jess\u2019 iPhone\nas the control for time and location, I sequenced the photos into a time line. The\nevidence shows they climbed the east face of Howse from their camp at the base to\nthe summit (an altitude gain of 1,340 meters) in less than seven hours. Their ascent\nis a tribute to their strength, talent, and tenacity. Their deaths prove once again,\nthough, that the mountain passes final judgment on success or failure.\n    The three men, all members of the North Face athlete team, arrived in Canmore\nthe first week in April. They quickly made ascents of Andromeda Strain and Neme-\nsis, and then, on April 15, the three headed for Howse Peak. After an eight-kilometer\nski approach, they camped below the east face. That evening, Hansj\u00f6rg took several\nphotos of small powder snow avalanches sweeping their intended route.\n    The route they followed the next day started up M-16, a difficult mixed climb with\nonly one previous ascent (1999), then began a series of leftward traverses on some\npreviously unclimbed and difficult terrain. Eventually they reached a large, concave\nsnow basin above a waterfall route known as Life by the Drop. Ankle-deep in sun-\nwarmed snow, Jess took the lead up the moderate snow basin to reach the south-\n west ridge. After more mixed climbing along the\nridge, the three reached the summit prior to 12:41\np.m. The sun was shining, but a few clouds were\nstarting to move in.\n     Sometime after Jess\u2019 summit photo taken\nat 12:44 p.m., the three climbers began their\ndescent. At 1:27 p.m., Hansj\u00f6rg took the last photo\nfound on any of the three cameras. The photo is\nprobably of David at the bottom of their rappel\nfrom the ridge into the snow basin.\n     Just before 2 p.m., Quentin Roberts, an alpin-\nist living in Canmore, stopped along the Icefields\nParkway on his way back from a climb farther\nnorth to examine the routes on Howse Peak. As\nhe and his partner stood looking at the east face,\nan avalanche swept the basin above the route\nLife by the Drop and billowed onto the glacier at\nthe bottom of the face. They did not know that\nHansj\u00f6rg, David, and Jess were on the face at the\ntime. A massive snow cloud formed at the bottom\nof the face. It was 1:58 p.m., 31 minutes after the\nthree climbers had entered the basin.\n     Jess always phoned in after a climb, and he\nhad told Allison, his wife, they would be out of\nthe mountains that night. If he was unable to The line climbed on the east face of\nphone, he would have texted his position to her Howse Peak on April 16. The climbers\n                                                      were avalanched from the obvious snow\non his Garmin inReach device. No message came. bowl near the top during their descent\nAt 7:30 a.m. on April 17, I called Royal Canadian from the summit.

They immediately dispatched a ranger to the Waterfowl\nLakes parking lot to see if Jess\u2019 truck was still there. It was.\n     A Parks Canada search and rescue team was flown by helicopter to the base of\nHowse Peak. Clouds now blanketed the mountain. As they flew toward the avalanche\ncones at the bottom of the face, the rangers were drawn to a dark shadow in the\nsnow. A close inspection from the helicopter indicated at least one climber was buried\nhalfway up the large avalanche cone below Life by the Drop.\n     Avalanche conditions were extreme, so the SAR team decided not to put rescuers\non the ground. Because the climbers were not wearing transceivers, the team tossed\ntwo large fluorescent traffic cones and two avalanche beacons where the climber(s)\nwere located and then departed. For the next four days, bad weather prevented\nsearch and rescue or recovery efforts.\n     On April 20, the weather was clear and sunny. A SAR team on board a helicopter\nsearched up and down the mountain, looking for signs of survivors. Nothing was seen\nafter a meticulous search. They then concentrated their efforts on recovery. The\nSAR team, plus a recovery dog and her handler, were flown to a staging area below\nthe face. They made one sortie to probe the avalanche cone, with the SAR members",

        "Details_Factors": "Unclipped from Anchor\nAlberta, Banff National Park, Icefields Parkway\nTwo climbers (male, 33, and female, 36) left their car at 5 a.m. on March 25, plan-\nning to climb Polar Circus, a long ice route above the Icefields Parkway. The risk of\nan avalanche was rated \u201cmoderate,\u201d and during the previous evening the team had\ndiscussed trying to get up and down the route by about noon in order to minimize\nexposure to wet slab avalanches.\n    Approach conditions were slow, with crusty post-holing, but the approach ice\npitches went quickly, and the pair reached the start of the guidebook pitches at about\n7 a.m. After guidebook pitches one through three, there was another long, slow stretch\nof post-holing to get to the upper tiers.\n    Climber 1 attempted to link pitches four and five but came up short of the bolted\nbelay. This long pitch took just over an hour to lead. Climber 2 then led a short\nsegment of ice and slogged through snow to reach the belay atop pitch five. When the\nfirst climber arrived, she pointed out that it was nearly 11 a.m. and the slopes above the\nclimb were now in the sun. She indicated the team should turn back, as per the previous\nevening\u2019s conversation. Climber 1 responded that the team was \u201ctwo pitches from the\ntop\u201d (not true) and he \u201cdidn\u2019t come to Canada to turn back now.\u201d He started up pitch six,\nclimbing quickly and placing minimal protection. He attempted to link pitches six and\nseven with their 60-meter ropes but did not reach the belay stance, and the belayer\ndeclined to simul-climb due to the lack of protection. Therefore, the leader built a\nbelay one bulge below the snow ledge that marks the top of pitch seven. The anchor\nhad no ice screws, using only the leader\u2019s ice tools.\n    Climber 2 followed the pitch and continued up past\nClimber 1\u2019s belay onto the snow ledge. She found the\ntwo-bolt anchor, clipped her belay device to an equalized\nsling, and began to pull up the ropes. She felt resistance\nand inserted the ropes into the belay device. Her partner\nthen yelled, \u201cThey\u2019re tangled.\u201d Climber 2 continued to pull\nup rope until she had about six to eight feet of slack in\nher hands. Meanwhile, her partner had gotten uncom-\nfortable at his hanging belay, and he unclipped from his\nanchor and stepped up to reach the tangled ropes. After\nClimber 2 pulled up a few more feet of rope, her partner\u2019s\nfeet suddenly blew and he fell about 50 feet because of\nthe slack still in the rope tangle. He stopped on a slop-\ning ledge. Up top, his partner tried to hold the ropes in\nher hands, but they burned through her gloves until her\npartner weighted the belay device clipped to the anchor.\n    Climber 2 yelled down to her partner, but he was unre-\nsponsive, so she escaped the belay and began to descend\nthe unweighted strand of their half ropes. However, she\nsoon realized there was a massive core shot in the rope, so\nUpper pitches of Polar Circus: (1) Climber 2\u2019s belay. (2) Climber\u2019s 1\u2019s\nstance.

She could now\nsee Climber 1, and she coached him through building a screw anchor and unweighting\nhis rope. She then reascended to the anchor using prusiks and prepared to rappel, using\na knot block so she could descend the single undamaged rope and pull it down with\nthe core-shot strand. In similar fashion, the team descended the rest of the route with\n11 rappels and post-holing. They made it back to the car by about 6:30 p.m. Climber 1\nhad a possible concussion, a fracture in one arm, and a possible back injury.\n\nANALYSIS\nClimber 1 (the climber who fell): \u201cMy comfort in such terrain led to complacency, the\nmost dangerous thing of all. Under no circumstances should one ever unclip from\nan anchor until they are on belay.\u201d\n   Climber 2: \u201cClear communication between partners is a safety concern.

        "Details_Factors": "Uneven Ropes, No Stopper Knots\nNuevo Le\u00f3n, El Potrero Chico\nBrad Gobright, 31, one of the best-known big-wall climbers and soloists in North\nAmerica, died in a rappelling accident at El Potrero Chico on November 27. Gobright\nand his climbing partner for the day (male, 26) had teamed up to attempt El Sendero\nLuminoso, a 15-pitch limestone route. They had not climbed together before.\n   The two successfully climbed the 5.12+ route, with Gobright onsighting the entire\nclimb. To descend, they planned to simul-rappel the route from bolted anchors,\nusing a single 80-meter rope. The descent went smoothly until midafternoon, when\nthey reached a stance above the large bivy ledge on top of pitch five. Realizing they\ndid not have enough rope to reach this ledge in one rappel, they decided to do two\nshorter rappels.\n   After the first rappel, the two prepared for a short rappel to the big ledge below.\nAccording to accounts provided by Gobright\u2019s partner, they did not pull the rappel\nrope all the way to the middle mark at the anchor, because it looked obvious they\nhad enough rope out on both sides. One end of the rope could be seen on the ledge\nbelow, while the other strand (Gobright\u2019s side) was tangled in bushes below them.\n   As on the previous rappels, the two began descending together, counter-balanc-\ning each other\u2019s weight in a simul-rappel. Gobright said he would untangle the rope\nfrom the bushes en route. Suddenly, both men began dropping. The partner fell\nthrough some bushes and onto the ledge, without tumbling off the far side. Gobright\ncontinued falling and did not survive.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe evidence in published accounts strongly suggests the rope ends were not even\nand that the strand on Gobright\u2019s side was too short to reach the ledge. This fact was\nhidden by the bushes in which the rope was tangled, and he did not see the problem\nuntil the rope end passed through his rappel device.\n    The climbers were not using stopper knots in the ends of the rope. This was\nlikely a conscious decision, because the many rock flakes, bushes, and cacti along\nthis 1,500-foot descent could snag a rappel rope, and stopper knots can make ropes\nmore prone to snagging, especially if there is any wind. However, it is also possible to\nkeep the rope ends with you as you rappel (or one end with each climber in the case\nof simul-rappelling) to maintain control of the ends. If these two climbers had tied\nstopper knots, it\u2019s very unlikely this fatal accident would have occurred.\n    In simul-rappelling, when one climber unweights the rope prematurely, the\nother will drop, and this was the case for Gobright\u2019s partner. When he landed on\nthe ledge, his rappel device and third-hand backup were still connected to the rope,\nwhich pulled through the anchor and dropped to the ledge after him. The partner\nwas extremely lucky to land on one of the few sizable ledges on this entire route. He\nwas able to descend with the assistance of other climbers.

        "Details_Factors": "Poor Position, Rope Cut, Anchor Tether Failure\nChugach Mountains, Pioneer Peak\nPioneer Peak looms over the Knik River, northeast of Anchorage. The north face is\na broad pyramid laced with gullies, starting at 500 feet above sea level and rising to\nthe summit at 6,398 feet. The classic route follows a direct line to the summit ridge,\nbeginning with 20\u00b0 slopes and gradually steepening to about 60\u00b0. Along the way are\na couple of steeper ice pitches, the first at about 1,000 feet into the route and the\nsecond at about 4,000 feet.\n    Fallon Connolly, 26, and Simon Frez-Albrecht, age 28 (both experienced climbers),\nstarted up the face at 5:45 a.m. on April 15. It had been 37\u00b0F at the car. After about an\nhour, they neared the first technical pitch (30 meters, WI3). Above this, they unroped\nand continued snow climbing for about two hours.The gully ramped up to about 50\u00b0\nshortly before the upper technical pitch.\n    Fallon observed signs of what appeared to be fairly recent avalanches on the gully\nwalls. Simon had checked the weather stations in Hatcher Pass, about 25 miles away\nas the crow flies, for recent nighttime temperatures, and found they had been below\nfreezing above roughly 3,000 feet the last couple of nights. The forecast for Palmer\n(halfway between Hatcher and Pioneer at 250 feet above sea level) was for a daytime\nhigh in the low 40s and rain in the afternoon. Simon figured the bottom half of the\nroute would be above freezing, but anticipated the upper face could have good n\u00e9v\u00e9\nconditions. Indeed, the snow kept getting better and firmer the higher they got, but\nthey later determined this was from being buffed by avalanches, not frozen solid.\n    Shortly before entering a pinch leading to the upper ice pitch, both heard/sensed\na faint booming-rumbling sound or sensation that made them pause. They discussed\nit briefly. Could it be a distant sonic boom from military jets? Noise from the firing\nrange? A snow whumph? After another minute, Fallon identified a similar sound/feel-\ning, but they agreed to continue upward. They later deduced these had been distant\navalanches on another aspect of the mountain.\n    Simon was about 50 feet ahead of Fallon and had nearly reached a position to\nanchor for the upper ice pitch when he noticed a very small (D0.5 or D1) wet loose\navalanche come tumbling over the ice above. He yelled down to warn Fallon. Simon\n was standing to one side of the gully, and it didn\u2019t hit him, but it all washed directly\nover Fallon; she planted both tools firmly and put her head down to let the snow pass.\nThey estimated the flow lasted 60 seconds.\n    After the flow stopped, Fallon continued up to where Simon was waiting and they\nmoved together perhaps 50 feet up and to the opposite side of the gully, where there\nwere some obvious cracks in the rock. Around 11:15 to 11:30, Simon dug some snow\nout and found a placement for a perfect number 2 Camalot, which he clipped into\nwhile placing a number 4 Black Diamond Stopper in the crack formed by a chockstone\nabout a foot above. Simon equalized the two pieces with a 60cm Dyneema sling. They\nboth clipped in, Fallon using an 8mm Dyneema runner girth-hitched through both\nhardpoints on her harness. Given what they had observed, they agreed it would be\nprudent to descend from this point.\n    To build a bail anchor, they dug snow out of a horizontal seam about two feet\nbelow the Stopper and forced a knifeblade piton in about halfway before it began\ndeforming. Simon tied off the blade with 6mm cord and equalized it with the nut,\nintentionally shifting slightly more force to nut. He bounce-tested the anchor and\nthen set up their brand-new 7.8mm ropes for a rappel, with the pink rope threaded\nthrough the masterpoint and tied to the green rope with a single offset overhand\nand a single overhand \u201cbackup.\u201d Fallon pre-rigged her device on the rappel ropes\nbut did not install a friction-hitch backup. The number 2 Camalot was clipped to\nthe ropes as a backup with a non-locker on a 60cm sling. Fallon remained clipped\nto the cord masterpoint with a locking carabiner as Simon began to rappel, using an\nEdelrid Giga Jul. When Simon was about halfway down, Fallon yelled to warn of an\navalanche coming over the ice pitch above.\n    When Fallon saw the avalanche, she grabbed her tether near the carabiner and\npulled close to the rock wall, keeping as much of her weight on her feet as she could.\nShe was looking over her shoulder to see when the debris flow would stop when she\nwas hit in the face by a block. She was knocked off her feet and was hanging fully from\nher tether, getting buffeted by debris. Her gloves disappeared, and her glasses fell off.\nShe reached for the anchor to try to pull herself back upright but couldn\u2019t grab anything.\n    At around this point, the pink rope broke. (The climbers later deduced it was cut\nby an edge of the rock near the anchor.) However, the knot joining the two ropes\njammed in Fallon\u2019s pre-rigged rappel device, keeping the green rope attached to the\nanchor via her belay device and her tether. At this point, Simon was fully hanging\nfrom the belay device rigged on Fallon\u2019s belay loop.\n    Simon had assumed the avalanche would be small, like the earlier one, so he tried\nmoving to the side of the gully. However, debris almost immediately pulled him into\nthe fall line, knocked him off his feet, and flowed over him. He felt rope slipping\nthrough his gloved brake hand and tried to hold on, but then had his hand knocked\noff the ropes and felt that he was sliding down the ropes in halting jerks. Eventually\nhe came to a hard stop on the rope but kept getting pummeled. After one to three\nminutes, the flow slowed and then stopped. Simon stood up and found that a tangle\nin the green rope had jammed in his belay device, stopping him from going further.\nThe pink rope was piled in a mess near him.\n    Once Simon stood up and unweighted the rope, Fallon got back on her feet and\nimmediately noticed the pink rope had been cut. She grabbed the green rope and\n clipped it through the carabiner on the number 2 Camalot, but did not use a knot to\nanchor it. Simon and Fallon began trying to communicate\u2014Simon yelling to fix the\ngreen rope and hurry down, Fallon not hearing clearly what he was saying. As Fallon\ninspected the anchor, the next rumble started above.\n    The second avalanche knocked Fallon off her feet, and instantly she knew she\nwas falling. She tumbled down the slope in the debris, totally disoriented. Simon\nsaw the second flow beginning to spill over the ice pitch and hurried to get behind a\nrock outcrop in the middle of the gully. A small, roof-shaped feature protected him\nas the debris flowed past, but then he was plucked from his stance by tugging on his\nharness. Almost immediately he understood that Fallon had come detached from the\nanchor and was falling below him. He tumbled head over heels down the slope until\nfinally he was able to dig in his heels and stop after about 100 feet. Fallon had fallen\n300 to 400 feet from the anchor to where she stopped.\n    The two yelled back and forth again, and Fallon started moving onto a small rib\nof rock outcrops in the middle of the gully. Simon untangled his ice tools from the\nclippers on his harness and hurriedly downclimbed and slid the 45\u00b0 slope to Fallon.\nHe noticed pain in his ribs on the right side during certain motions, but otherwise\ndidn\u2019t notice any significant injuries. When Simon reached her, she was obviously in\ndistress, and told him that she had lost her gloves, helmet, and ice tools. Her beacon\nhad been torn out of the thigh pocket of her Gore-Tex pants. She got a second pair\nof gloves out of her backpack and moved off the rock toward Simon, who gave her\none of his tools. He hurried Fallon to shelter in the lee of a larger rock outcrop just\nbelow them, providing a short rope for security.\n    Behind the rock outcrop, they caught their breath and formulated a plan. A raised\narea of the snowfield on the other side of a large debris path led into a more defined\nrib sticking out between gullies farther down the mountain. They aimed to stay on\nthis high point as they worked their way down the mountain. After listening carefully\nfor the rumbling of another avalanche, they began to hurry across the gully to the\nhigh point. Simon was a few feet uphill of Fallon, keeping her on a short rope as they\nmoved together. Getting on the high point, they again paused to catch their breath\nbefore continuing down. They were comforted by the rib gaining prominence as they\ndescended, as well as the increased density of alders and spruce trees.\n    In the areas unaffected by the avalanches, they found knee- to hip-deep post-\nholing in the soft snow. As they got lower into the dense alders, the snowpack was\nthinner, and Fallon kicked off several collapses and small avalanches, sliding on a satu-\nrated layer essentially at the ground interface. Eventually the rib began to cliff out, so\nthey made a 20-meter rappel off a clump of alders. More downclimbing through 45\u00b0\nalder slopes brought them to the anchor at the top of the first belayed pitch. They\nadded a piton to the anchor, rigged what was left of their rope for a rappel, and then\nwere able to walk down to the road. They reached the car at 4:45 p.m.; the tempera-\nture was 41\u00b0F and light rain was falling.\n    Simon\u2019s injuries included several rope burns and crampon pokes, a bruised rib, a\nstrained left bicep and wrist, and other pain and stiffness. Fallon had painful (prob-\nably broken) ribs on the lower left side, badly bruised and swollen knees, two black\neyes and a swollen lip, and cuts and soreness at various other points all over her body.\n(Sources: Simon Frez-Albrecht and Fallon Connolly.)\n ANALYSIS\nReviewing incidents in the past, I (Simon) could point to obvious red flags or glaring\nmistakes in decision-making. The clues that we missed this time were more subtle,\nand therefore it\u2019s harder to draw conclusions about what to do better next time.\n    Apart from not going on the face at all or turning back in the first hour, we could\nnot have been more fortunate with our timing. If we had been slower or had turned\naround when we first heard/sensed the ominous noise, we likely would have been\nunroped and right in the gun barrel when the slides hit, and we could have been swept\nto the bottom of the face. If we had been faster, I would have been leading the upper\nice pitch, taking a lead fall as well as a pummeling.\n    Even though this is one of our local mountains, we had been away for the past two\nweeks, so were out of touch with the snowpack and weather patterns. The human\nfactor known as \u201cscarcity\u201d made me want to jump onto the face\u2014I suspected this\nmight be the last day of the spring season to climb the route. We felt we had pieced\ntogether enough information to make an informed decision. I suspected the shed\ncycle had already happened in the previous warm, sunny days, so there wouldn\u2019t be\na significant amount of loose/available snow left on the mountain to slide onto us. I\ndidn\u2019t consider that the freezing at night had been enough to keep the snow locked\nin place, poised above us.\n    Probably the single most obvious clue we missed was that it had stayed cloudy\nthe night before our climb, preventing the radiant cooling that had dropped night-\ntime temps in the previous days. This kept the snowpack wet and near the tipping\npoint when the weak sun struck the face for a couple of hours through the clouds.\n    In the moments leading up to the avalanche, we felt good that we were heading\ndown, heeding the warning signal sent by the small wet sluff. We didn\u2019t yet under-\nstand that this sluff was the last of several subtle warnings telling us that this was\nnot a good day to be climbing on Pioneer.\n    I went back up about 10 days later when we had another spell of freezing nights.\n(This time the snow was crunchy underfoot right from the car.) I wanted to inves-\ntigate the anchor to see why we had come off, but didn\u2019t find much in the way of\nanswers. The nut was firmly locked in place, with that leg of the anchor cord and the\nmasterpoint still in good condition;\nthe cord that I had tied off on the\npiton had been cut. The Camalot\nabove was still in place, with the\nsling and non-locker dangling\nfrom it, slightly deformed. Fallon\u2019s\ntether and the locking carabiner\ncame down with her when she fell.\nWhy had she come unclipped from\nthe anchor? The only conclusion\nwe can draw is that the screw-gate\nlocker with which Fallon clipped\n                                         [Left] Post-avalanche view of the anchor on Pioneer\nher tether to the masterpoint must Peak. The anchor was mostly intact; only the cord to the\nhave jiggled to the unlocked posi- piton had failed. [Right] The rope likely was cut by sawing\ntion during the first avalanche. against a sharp rock edge. Simon Frez-Albrecht\n Then, when she unweighted the tether, the locker must have shifted into a position\nwhere it could unclip itself when the second avalanche pushed her back onto her tether.\n    As I inspected the anchor, I identified a sharp rock edge below and to the side that\nmatched up with where the rope had been cut. We concluded that the large oscil-\nlations and force on the rope during the avalanche, as it loaded over a sharp edge of\nrock, had cut the rope.\n    Over the last year or two, I have been making a conscious effort to increase my\nsafety margin while climbing. This includes tying knots in the ends of ropes during\nrappels, using a rappel backup, and using autolocking carabiners and assisted brak-\ning belay devices more often. I had recently been toying with pre-rigging rappel\ndevices as well, but was not doing this consistently. For whatever reason, this was\none of those times we pre-rigged Fallon\u2019s belay device on the rope, and by snagging\nthe knot joining the ropes after our pink rope cut, it happened to keep me alive.\n(Source: Simon Frez-Albrecht.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Flipped Upside Down\nHatcher Pass, The Monolith\nOn July 14, I met up with two partners to climb some trad routes in Hatcher Pass. I had\nbeen leading trad for more than four years and regularly traveled outside of Alaska\nto get practice outside of our very short summer climbing season.\n    After warming up on an easy climb, we moved over to a two-pitch 5.9+ route called\nOrangutan Overhang that I had not climbed before. I led the first pitch clean and\nbuilt an anchor on the ledge between the pitches. I brought up my followers, and we\ndiscussed whether to continue up the second pitch, which you could not see from\nthe ground. It looked slightly easier than the first pitch, and I decided to head up.\n    The pitch started in a corner that protected well and felt a bit steeper than it\nlooked. I got in a few pieces of gear before reaching a large chockstone that looked\nand felt loose. I moved past it quickly and did not protect close to it due to concern\nabout dislodging it. I found myself on a thin ledge that traversed right to a roof. I\nfound a very small horizontal placement (black Totem Cam, the smallest in their\nrange) before the move to the right. It wasn\u2019t a great placement, but there was mud\nand water running in the larger crack under the roof (typical for this area), and I didn\u2019t\nthink I could safely protect there.\n    I reached a pretty comfortable stance to check out the moves over the roof. There\nwas a short hand crack right above the roof and what looked like an OK high-step on\nthe right side. I checked that my left hand felt solid in the jam and then moved my\nright foot up to the high-step. I don\u2019t recall how I fell, but I pretty much immediately\nflipped upside down. I have some recollection of my head (and helmet!) impacting the\nrock, after which the black Totem pulled out and I slid down the face. I fell another\n20-plus feet before my other gear held me and I came to a stop close to the belay ledge.\n    I stood upright on the ledge to try to assess the situation. I had trouble speaking and\nhad to hold my neck stable to be able to breathe comfortably, so I lay down in the recov-\nery position and kept my neck supported out of concern about a spinal cord injury.\n    One of my partners rappelled the first pitch, activated my personal locator beacon\n(PLB), and helped coordinate rescue support. He was able to send up water, warm\n layers, etc., while my second partner stayed\non the ledge with me. At close to 9 p.m., I was\nrescued by helicopter from the ledge.\n    At the hospital, I was diagnosed with multi-\nple fractures to my C1 vertebra, an occipital\nskull fracture, multiple fractures to my upper\njaw, cheekbones, and nose, and a broken molar.\nA couple of weeks later, we found that I had a\nfull tear to my scapholunate ligament in my left\nhand and a partial tear to my MCL on my left\nknee. Fortunately, I have recovered well except\nfor some loss of range of motion in my neck and Helmet damaged in the Hatcher Pass fall.\nleft wrist.                                      Katherine Cooper\n\n\nANALYSIS\nI was aware that I didn\u2019t have good protection nearby (and even verbally noted that to\nmy belayer), but decided to try the move anyway. I was accustomed to being a little\nabove my gear, especially on various alpine climbs that I\u2019ve done. I expected the gear\nthat was good to keep me off the ground\u2014which it did\u2014but I grossly misjudged the fall\nrisk in that spot. I just didn\u2019t consider that I might be flipped upside down in the fall.\n(All I can think is that my high right foot put my center of balance in a weird place.)\nUnfortunately, I think I may have been just as injured if the piece had not pulled\u2014my\ngear was too far down and left of my fall line.\n    I also think that while I was feeling physically strong, my technique (specifically\nfootwork) might have been worse than usual due to the gym closure earlier in the\nyear. I had climbed very little since the COVID-19 closures in early March. (Source:\nKatherine Cooper.)",

        "Incident_Type": "MT. SHASTA ANNUAL SUMMARY- 2020 ",
        "Details_Factors": "\nMt. Shasta and Castle Crags Wilderness\nThe number of accidents and searches on Mt. Shasta was down from the last couple\nof seasons, most likely due to COVID-19 and the associated forest closure and stay-\nat-home orders, which kept people off the mountain for a while. In 2020, the U.S.\nForest Service (USFS) sold 4,633 summit passes, compared with the 20-year aver-\nage of 6,467. In total, there were 12 search and rescue incidents on Mt. Shasta (not\nall involving climbing), while the average is 20 per year. Unfortunately, one of the\naccidents resulted in a fatality. Below are details of some of the incidents.\n    On Monday, March 2, a 50-year-old male climber contacted the USFS climbing\nrangers looking for assistance in recovering his tent and belongings from Lake Helen.\nHe had been planning a solo, two-day winter climb of the Avalanche Gulch route,\nwith a camp at Lake Helen, but cold and strong wind made for a challenging expe-\n rience setting up his tent. He turned back and abandoned the majority of his gear,\nand he reported having severe frostbite on his fingers when he returned home. The\nclimber\u2019s tent was recovered the next day, tangled in the rocks a few hundred feet\nbelow Lake Helen. Setting up a tent in difficult conditions is an often underestimated\nskill in winter mountaineering.\n    On June 14, a climber called 911 reporting severe right shoulder pain after a self-\narrest attempt while glissading above Lake Helen. The climber had been descending\nafter a successful summit with a partner and a guide. While glissading, she began\ngoing too fast and attempted to self-arrest, but the axe grabbed the snow in such a\nway that injured her shoulder. She attempted to hike down, but the pain was unbear-\nable, and she called for help. The decision was made to evacuate her by helicopter.\n    Late in the afternoon on June 21, rangers received information about an injured\nclimber at 11,000 feet on the west face route. When rangers arrived on scene, an\nassessment revealed possible broken ribs and breathing complications on the right\nside of the chest. The reporting party stated the climber had fallen while downclimb-\n                                                         ing a 50\u00b0 slope, losing control and\n                                                         colliding with a rock garden at the\n                                                         bottom. The climber was extracted\n                                                         via helicopter.\n                                                             A week later, a 55-year-old\n                                                         climber also slipped and fell while\n                                                         descending the same general area\n                                                         on the west face. The climber had\n                                                         crampons on and an ice axe in his\n                                                         hand when he slipped and slid 400\n                                                         feet, colliding with an exposed rock\n                                                         patch at the bottom of the snow\n                                                         slope. His partner stated that the\n                                                         man was speaking in German (he\n                                                         usually speaks English) and was alert\n                                                         and oriented only to his name.\nTwo falls in late June occurred in the same general\n                                                             When rangers arrived, a head-\nlocation (circled) on Mt. Shasta\u2019s west face route. Nick\nMeyers | USFS                                            to-toe assessment revealed facial\n                                                         trauma, black-and-blue eyes, and\npain in the right shoulder and upper thoracic spine. The patient was wearing a helmet.\nTwo nearby climbers hiked up to help, and one was instructed to hold C-spine. It was\ndetermined to be unsafe to carry the patient without a litter, so rangers hiked in a SKED\nlitter from the helicopter landing zone in Hidden Valley. The patient was packaged in\nthe SKED and carried down across rock and snow to the Hidden Valley camp, where\nhe was loaded into a helicopter for transport to the hospital.\n    On July 5, a climber who had summited via the Avalanche Gulch route got off\nroute during his descent and headed onto the Whitney Glacier. The 47-year-old was\nequipped with crampons and a single trekking pole. After the recent low-precipi-\ntation winters, the Whitney Glacier is a jumbled mess of rock, ice, and crevasses.\nThe climber, now marooned on an island of rocks at about 13,000 feet, reported\nthat \u201cmoving off the rock pile may cost him his life.\u201d Yet, while waiting for rescue,\n the climber decided to try and descend on his\nown, haphazardly glissading on a path that took\nhim over a crevasse and onto a snow bridge in\nanother crevasse. During his fall, the climber\ninjured his neck and nose. He climbed out of the\ncrevasse and began to descend again, this time\navoiding crevasses, before stopping near 11,000\nfeet. The helicopter and rescuers redirected\nafter locating the climber\u2019s new position, and\nrangers arrived on scene at 8 p.m. and helped\nthe climber to the landing zone at 10,400 feet.\n    On September 25, Chelsey Klein and Jeffrey\nSutton started from the Northgate trailhead and\nset up camp two miles up the trail as the sun\nbegan to set. The next morning, they attempted\nto climb the Hotlum-Bolam Ridge. Approximately\neight hours into their day, the pair decided to\ndescend from a high point near 13,000 feet. In\nlate afternoon, at about 12,000 feet, they real-\nized they had deviated from their ascent route. Rangers\u2019 makeshift bivouac with meager\n                                                         shelter from rockfall during an extended\nThey put on crampons, got out their ice axes,\n                                                         rescue in the Trinity Chutes area. Nick\nand attempted to traverse across the western Meyers | USFS\nreaches of the Hotlum Glacier to regain the\nlateral moraine. As they traversed, Sutton slipped and fell, tumbling a few hundred\nfeet down the very icy slope. Conditions were such that self-arrest was impossible.\n    Klein called 911 and reported that Sutton was unconscious. After a few minutes\nhe began to move and attempted to stand up, but then slipped a second time and fell\nout of view. Late that night, with assistance from California National Guard, Klein\nwas rescued by helicopter. The crew returned to search for Sutton, but was unable to\nlocate him. Two climbing rangers were inserted to 8,600 feet, and additional search-\ners began hiking from Northgate trailhead. At sunrise, rangers began searching the\nglacier and located Sutton, who was deceased.\n    On October 5, a 23-year-old climber slipped and fell from 12,500 feet in the middle\nof the Trinity Chutes in Avalanche Gulch. At this time of the year, the south side of\nthe mountain was completely devoid of snow, and the Trinity Chutes is one of the\nmost rockfall-prone portions of the mountain. The climber called 911 and reported\na chief complaint of two broken ankles.\n    With little time left in the day, a helicopter crew inserted two rangers to Helen Lake.\nThe plan was to move the climber to a safer location for the night, preparing for a hoist\nthe following morning. Rangers arrived on scene and found multiple lacerations head\nto toe (no helmet), a severe open thumb injury, possible broken ribs and broken left\nankle, and possible dislocated right ankle. Rangers moved the climber to a location\naway from the active rockfall, behind a moderate sized boulder on the 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 slope.\nIt was now dark, and they determined it would be unsafe to haul the climber down the\nslope any further. The patient was covered in emergency blankets and warm garments,\nand the rangers took cover from the ongoing rockfall behind some small boulders.\n     In the early morning, California Highway Patrol\u2019s H-14 helicopter arrived on\nscene. There was pressure to get the patient to a lower elevation, as the CHP crew\nwere not confident they could hoist the patient from this elevation. However, after\nstripping the helicopter of extraneous equipment and burning off fuel, they were\nable to conduct the hoist near maximum power. All rescue personnel made it off the\nmountain safely.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe snowpack on Shasta was far below the historic average, which meant the safest\nclimbing conditions were earlier in the spring than usual and didn\u2019t last long\u2014espe-\ncially since the USFS closed the mountain above 10,000 feet from April 23 to May\n15 because of concerns related to the pandemic. When the closure lifted, Shasta\nreceived heavy visitation, and some climbers, despite warnings, gave the mountain\na go all season long. As the snow melted out, there was a gradual increase in rockfall\nand icy snow surfaces, and slip-and-fall consequences were greatly exacerbated by\nfalls that terminated into boulders.\n    As usual, there were a couple of searches for climbers who were unfamiliar with\nthe terrain, separated from their group, did not have navigation tools, and/or got\nlost in poor weather or limited visibility.\n    Mt. Shasta is often described as a \u201cbeginner\u201d mountaineering objective, but the\ntechnical requirements should not be understated. Climbers looking to grow their\nmountaineering skills should strongly consider hiring a guide who can supervise the\npractice of new skills and add a margin of safety. (Mt.

Jane began leading, but a few bolts up she asked to get lowered.\nThe climbers switched roles and Alex ascended the route to the bolted anchor. He\nclipped the rope through two alpine quickdraws for a top-rope anchor, and Jane\nbegan to lower him. She reported that Alex asked her to \u201cstop\u201d or \u201chold on\u201d about\nhalfway to the ground (approximately 35 feet). He appeared to be manipulating\nsomething on his harness and then suddenly fell to the ground.\n    Rangers responded and provided emergency medical care (Alex had a fractured\nfemur and other injuries), then performed a low-angle evacuation to transport him\nto a park ambulance.\n\nANALYSIS\nDuring the investigation, rangers inspected the route and climbing gear. The climb-\ners\u2019 rope was still hanging from the anchor, with a properly tied figure-eight follow-\nthrough knot jammed against the carabiners clipped to the slings. The knot was not\ntied to anything. The ranger performing medical care on Alex found all his buckles\nintact and properly secured when removing the harness.

Alex tied in\nwith the lead rope still clipped into a\ncouple of bolts above him, and the rope\nmay have obscured the incorrect tie-in.\nHe may have noticed something amiss\nwhile lowering and might have been\nmanipulating the harness when the loop\ncame undone.\n    Although these two had climbed\ntogether before, they were not regu-\nlar partners.

While rappelling the very overhanging first pitch with the haulbag, Climber\nA rappelled over a small roof and got too far away from the wall to reach the ledge\nat the bottom of the pitch, despite clipping some directionals during his descent.\n(The West Face route is approached by a ramp that traverses onto the face, so the\nfirst anchor is far above the ground.) Since the climber could not reach the ramp,\nhe continued rappelling to a lower ledge. This ledge had no permanent anchor, and\nClimber A was not carrying the right pieces to construct a solid anchor. With no\nway to anchor the haul bag, he could not detach it from the ropes nor reascend the\nropes to reach the ramp.\n    During their descent, the two climbers had called Yosemite Search and Rescue to\n    THE ART OF THE BAIL\n   Bailing off a steep route is a nearly inevitable outcome if you climb enough walls,\n   so it\u2019s best to know how to get down safely before you find yourself dangling\n   in space, wishing you knew what to do. Yosemite climbing rangers advise the\n   following techniques for rappelling overhanging routes with a haulbag.\n   (1) The first person descending should rappel on a fixed single strand with a Grigri\n       or a similar locking belay device, clipping both strands of the rappel ropes\n       to directional pieces to keep them close to the wall. They should also carry\n       equipment to reascend the fixed rope in case of getting too far from the wall\n       or rappelling past the anchor.\n   (2) When the first person arrives at the lower anchor, they should feed out five\n       to ten feet of slack rope, tie a knot with both ropes, and clip the knot to the\n       anchor. This will close the system for the second rappeller and allow the\n       second person to pull themself into the wall to unclip directionals on their\n       way down and to pull into the anchor at the end of the rappel.\n   (3) The second rappeller should untie the fixed strand from the upper anchor or\n       undo any knot-blocks, and then rappel both strands as normal, using a tube-\n       style device (such as an ATC) and a third-hand backup. They can unclip and\n       clean the directional pieces as they descend. Note: The second person down\n       should carry the team\u2019s heaviest gear (haulbag, etc.), because the tube-style\n       device produces a smoother rappel than a Grigri. Plus, they should not have\n       any reason to reascend the rope because it will be fixed to the lower anchor.\n                                            \u2014 Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers\nrequest some advice; climbing rangers were able to assist them over the phone with\ntheir first rappels, but soon decided to send SAR members to Leaning Tower in case\nfurther assistance was needed. When SAR members arrived, they fixed a rope and\nlowered it to Climber A, and he was able to leave his haul bag and jumar out. They\nthen secured the team\u2019s rappel ropes to the ledge so the second climber could rappel\ndirectly to the approach ramp. The ropes and haulbag were retrieved later that day.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Leaning Tower is one of the steepest big walls in North America, the lower half of\nwhich overhangs at an average angle of 110 degrees. The West Face has been the site\nof numerous rappelling difficulties, and while Climber A did utilize some directionals,\nhe extended one piece with a long runner and soon found himself too far from the cliff\nto place more directional pieces.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection, Communication\nYosemite National Park, Tuolumne Meadows\nSome friends and I went to Lembert Dome on August 4. I was a moderately experi-\nenced sport and gym climber but new to trad climbing. One friend climbed the first\n pitch of Northwest Books (5.6) and left the gear\nfor me so I could \u201cpinkpoint\u201d the route for my\nfirst trad lead. However, she did not place much\ngear: The bolt protecting the moves to the layback\ncrack was clipped, and then she placed only two\nother pieces. These were maybe eight to 12 feet\napart in a layback section. One of the alpine draws\nwas also extended.\n    When I reached the point between the two\npieces, I attempted to place a piece with the two\nrandom cams my friends had given me to \u201cplay\nwith\u201d for practice. (They thought they had sewed YOSAR at work. NPS Photo\nup the route and I wouldn\u2019t need gear for actual\nprotection.) Neither of the pieces fit the crack. After a minute my foot slipped and I\nfell down the slab, rolling to the right. I impacted on my butt and continued rolling\ndown the slab, hitting the back of my head. The foam lining of my helmet cracked.\n    My friends called 911, and Tuolumne Search and Rescue responded. They\nfound tingling in my toes and tenderness in my lumbar spine, and due to the likeli-\nhood of a spinal injury, I was put into a full-body vacuum splint for the lower to the\nground and carryout to the trail. At the hospital they found a fractured L1 vertebra.\nI was airlifted to Reno, Nevada, for possible spinal surgery, but luckily the fracture\nwas stable and I only needed bracing. (Source: Lynn Nguyen.)\n\nANALYSIS\nYosemite Search and Rescue listed the following takeaways from this incident:\n    Wear a helmet: When Lynn fell, she flipped upside down and cracked her helmet;\nthe outcome could have been much worse without one. Her foam-lined helmet\nhelped protect her head from side and rear impact.\n    Be honest with yourself (and your partners): Lynn was told the first party would\n\u201csew up\u201d the pitch and she would not need any other pieces to protect the climb.\nLater, her friend clarified that she had been \u201cspooked\u201d in the section after the first\npiece she placed, which is why she didn\u2019t stop to place more gear. If this had been\ncommunicated beforehand, Lynn might have made different decisions about the\nclimb.\n    Falls on low-angle climbs can be consequential: Many of the climbs in Tuolumne\nMeadows are slabby, polished, and have sparse protection, and \u201cbeginner\u201d routes\noften have numerous ledges. Climbers should be confident on the grade and style\nbefore leading these routes.\n    Gym routes are not comparable to outdoor routes: Climbing outside often requires\nskills not learned in the gym. Lynn mentioned not having much experience with\nlaybacking or slab climbing. In addition, the grades do not always reflect the lack of\nprotection, and original (\u201cold school\u201d) ratings can feel difficult by today\u2019s standards.\n    Be cautious using preplaced gear: Each climber will have a different idea of how\nmuch gear should be placed and where it is placed. While learning to use traditional\nprotection, consider practicing on top-rope; when ready to lead, bring extra pieces\nof protection. (Source: Yosemite National Park Climbing Rangers.)\n FALL ON SNOW\nEastern Sierra, Mt. Humphreys, North Couloir\nOn June 10, Inyo SAR was notified of an overdue climber (age 59 and experienced) in\nthe Mt. Humphreys area, west of Bishop. His wife reported that the climber\u2019s intended\nitinerary was to ascend the North Couloir (ice and snow up to 50\u00b0+) and descend the\neast ridge. Both are popular routes to summit.\n    Inyo SAR deployed three ground teams into the field by 8:30 a.m., heading for the\neast ridge, the North Couloir, and the approaches to the North Couloir. At 10 a.m.,\nSAR learned that friends of the climber had begun to search the night before and had\nlocated the deceased climber near the bergschrund at the base of the North Couloir\nat approximately 12,000 feet. Inyo SAR and the California Highway Patrol helicopter\ncompleted the recovery of the subject by 12 p.m.\n    Using the climber\u2019s Strava track, Inyo SAR was able to determine that he had\nsummited Mt. Humphreys, then returned via the North Couloir. It was obvious from\nthe tracks that the climber had taken a fall from high in the couloir, hit rocks on the\nright side of the gully, slid over the bergschrund, and come to rest on a snow shelf\njust below the bergschrund. Judging from his tracks, he did not move again once he\ncame to rest at the bergschrund.\n\nANALYSIS\nWe do not know the cause of the fall, but other parties reported hearing a large\nrockfall that morning, though no evidence of this was observed near the climber\u2019s\nup track or the slide marks. We also noted there was still abundant spring snow and\nit was a warm day. The footing in the couloir would have been treacherous as the\nday warmed up, and arresting a slip would have been difficult. The subject was well\nequipped for snow travel and carried a climbing rope. We cannot say with confidence\nthat the snow conditions played a factor in the subject\u2019s fall, but we recommend\nalpine starts for better snow stability and to anticipate changing (worsening) snow\nconditions during the day.

While they both had their\npacks off, they heard and then saw an\n\u201cexplosive fast-moving\u201d avalanche release\napproximately 300 to 500 feet above them.\nWith no time to react, both were caught\nup in the moving snow. The male was able\nto grab some rocks until the moving snow\npassed, but the female was carried out of\nsight down the canyon.\n    The male subject, now missing his skis\nand backpack, was able to move down the\ncanyon and eventually found his partner Avalanche on Independence Peak.

The total response included over 40 personnel. Upon arrival\nof the SAR team, the snow safety officer and other team members evaluated condi-\ntions and concluded that the area continued to have high avalanche danger. The\nSAR team and CHP determined that a helicopter hoist offered the fastest and safest\nmeans of extricating the injured subject. The patient was subsequently evacuated\nby the helicopter and taken to Southern Inyo County Hospital.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe avalanche started in steep, northeast-facing terrain at around 10,800 feet,\npresumably as a loose snow slide. At around 10,400 feet, a large wet slab avalanche\n released on a deeper weak layer with an estimated two- to four-foot crown. The\ntotal slide length was about 2,500 feet. Rapidly warming temperatures, partly cloudy\nskies, and a weak overnight refreeze of the snowpack were all likely contributing\nfactors. The nearest remote weather sensor (Charlotte Lake, 10,400 feet) recorded\na low of 35\u00b0F at 4 a.m., rising to 56\u00b0F at 11 a.m.\n    The party estimated that ski penetration while they were skinning (mostly in\nthe shady side of the chute) was no more than two inches, but on the sunny side it\nappeared to be softening more. They overestimated the surface refreeze, which they\nhad felt was deeper. They both had transceivers on, but the rescue equipment in their\npacks was swept away by the slide, as they were in the middle of transitioning. The\nskiers had five and 12 years of backcountry experience, no formal avalanche educa-\ntion, but quite a bit of informal education from experienced partners.\n    With warm temperatures the snowpack is unstable, especially in the heat of the\nday. It is common practice among ski tourers to begin the day with an alpine start\u2014\ngetting up well before daylight and turning around as soon as the snow starts to\nsoften. Both subjects are lucky to have survived this incident. (Sources: Inyo County\nSearch and Rescue and Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Complacency, No Stopper Knot\nJoshua Tree National Park, Echo Rock, West Face\nOn February 8, our group of friends of varying abili-\nties began climbing in the Echo Rock area of Joshua\nTree. One of the climbers in our group was prepar-\ning to lead Touch and Go (5.9) and mentioned that\nan easier climb should be set up as a top-rope for\nthose with less ability.\n    I (male, age 46) decided Double Dip (5.6) on Echo\nRock would be good. I was arguably the most expe-\nrienced in the group, with 22 years of on-and-off\nclimbing. Several factors led to my incorrect deter-\nmination that Double Dip was worthy of top-roping:\nI had done it several times (although many years\nago); I felt a sense of urgency to set up a climb for\nthe others; and I verified that we would be using a\n70-meter rope, with the knowledge that a 60-meter\nwouldn\u2019t be long enough for a top-rope setup on\nthis climb.\n    Rushing to rack up and tie in, I quickly chatted\nwith my belayer, with whom I\u2019d never climbed.

Double Dip angles slightly to the right\nacross the slab face of Echo Rock, and the fall line below the anchors lies along a 5.10\nslab. While lowering, I spent my time admiring the 5.10, thinking it would be another\nenjoyable top-rope. At a point that people in my group estimated to be roughly 25 to\n30 feet from the ground, the end of the rope slipped through my belayer\u2019s device and\nI began falling backward to the flat, sandy desert floor, at first backpedaling before\nskidding off the slab and landing on my shoulder and head.\n\nANALYSIS\nAfter the accident, I was re-educated as to the length of the climb: 130 feet. Setting\na top-rope required about 260 feet, and the 230-foot (70-meter) rope with stretch\ncame up about 25 feet short.\n    There were several points at which the accident chain could have been broken.\nI could have asked the party that had just climbed Double Dip why they walked off;\nI could have tied a knot in the other end of the rope or had my belayer tie in; I could\nhave asked my belayer to watch for the middle marker or to watch the rope as he\n lowered me; and, as an experienced climber, I certainly should have noted that I\nclimbed more than 35 meters to the bolted anchor.\n    I hold my belayer faultless. For argument\u2019s sake, the only thing he could have done\ndifferently was watch for the end of the rope. However, considering the certainty\nin my actions, his deferral to my experience, and my emphasis that a 70-meter rope\nwould reach, he had no reason to believe otherwise. Ultimately, I failed to follow\nsome basic safety protocols. The jovial atmosphere and comfort of familiarity lulled\nme into a false sense of security.\n    After much speculation for the worst, my only injuries besides some scrapes and\nbruises were a fractured transverse process and a compression between C6 and C7\nvertebra causing numbness down my left arm. The neck injury has since recovered\nwith extensive physical therapy. Aside from sheer luck, I credit my survival to several\nfactors: I landed on a flat sandy surface; I was wearing a helmet; the friction through\nthe carabiners and drag over the slab helped reduce my rate of acceleration; a few\nin my group had medical training and certification and leapt into immediate action;\nand I was afforded the fantastic and professional response of JOSAR.

From U.S. Highway 550, the group descended a snowy\nslope, crossed Red Mountain Creek, and ascended another slope to the base of a\nclimbing area known as the Dungeon or Petefish Slabs.\n    The guide led a pitch and set up a top-rope for the clients. Climbers 1 and 2\nclimbed the route with no issues and lowered to the base. While Climber 3 ascended\nthe route, Climber 1 moved slightly to the north of the route to take pictures while\nClimber 2 remained south of the guide, who belayed from under the route. Suddenly,\nthe group heard a loud cracking noise and ice and snow rained down. Climber 3 (on\nthe route) was hit by several chucks of ice but was not injured. Once the air cleared,\nthe group realized the snow and ice had hit and buried Climber 1.\n    The guide lowered Climber 3, who called 911.

Resuscitation efforts\nfrom a paramedic were unsuccessful.\n\nANALYSIS\nJanuary 18 had dawned clear and cold after a two-day storm ended the night before.\nA weather station one mile south of the accident site measured three inches of new\nsnow in the previous 24 hours. The weather station recorded a low temperature of\n0\u00b0F at 4 a.m., and the temperature rose to 10\u00b0F by 10 a.m.\n    In most avalanche accidents, the person injured by the avalanche or someone\nin that person\u2019s party triggers the slide. (In Colorado over the last 30 years, only\nabout seven percent of fatal avalanche accidents have involved a natural or spon-\ntaneous avalanche.) In this accident, however, a large chunk of ice broke away from\na supported pillar and triggered a small loose snow avalanche (approximately four\ninches deep) on the rock slab below.\n    The mix of broken ice and snow debris flowed over an ice-covered cliff and\nentrained additional loose snow on the slope below before stopping in the creek. The\nmoving snow alone was not enough to injure or bury a person, but the large chunks of\nice striking the victim and/or burial in the terrain trap below produced a fatal outcome.\n    This is the fifth fatal avalanche accident in Colorado during the past 10 years that\ninvolved a climber (about seven percent of avalanche fatalities over that 10-year\nperiod). None of the climbers in the group was carrying avalanche rescue equip-\nment, such as shovels and probes. Although it is not uncommon for ice climbers to\nventure into the mountains without this gear, it does limit their options in the event\nof an avalanche accident. In this case, the group\u2019s initial rescue effort was limited\nto digging with their hands and ice tools in probable locations. Technical climbers\nshould consider carrying avalanche rescue equipment, though in this case, given the\nnature of the debris and the narrow gorge below, it is unlikely the outcome would\nhave been different.

She couldn\u2019t clip the second bolt, fell and\nhit the ground, tripped backward, and hit her head. She was wearing a helmet. She\nwas dazed and after a few minutes started to complain of memory loss; she didn\u2019t\nknow where she was or what had happened. Nearby climbers with medical train-\ning checked her out and said there was a hematoma on the back of her head; one\nof them who was a nurse urged me to get her to medical attention soon so internal\nbleeding could be ruled out. We left our draws on the route, asking other climbers\nto retrieve them for us, and walked back to the parking lot, from which I drove her\nto the hospital for a CT scan.\n\nANALYSIS\nMy wife decided to lead the route even though she wasn\u2019t feeling super psyched\nabout it. I had grunted and hollered a bit as I led it, and that might have made her\na bit nervous.

Later, my wife and I agreed that, since she was not\nfeeling confident about the climb, she could have downclimbed a bit and lowered\noff. [Editor\u2019s Note: Nervous leaders also can consider stick-clipping the second bolt of\n a sport climb, which substantially improves the odds against a ground fall in case of a\nslip above the first bolt.]\n    I screwed up in my position as the lead belayer, standing down on the ground\ninstead of up on a higher ledge directly below the route.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped\nLongs Peak, North Chimney\nOn September 5, I planned to climb D7 (5.11c) on the Diamond of Longs Peak,\napproaching via the North Chimney. This is the most common approach to the\nDiamond and is a 500-foot rock climb rated 5.4. My partner and I had started up the\ntrail at 7 a.m., arriving at the base of the North Chimney around 9:30 a.m. We were\nwith two friends who would be roping up at the base of the North Chimney just\nbelow us. My climbing partner and I had soloed the North Chimney together earlier\nin the summer, so we didn\u2019t discuss if we were comfortable with this\u2014it was implied.\nAdditionally, with our relatively late start time, there was nobody on the route above\nus, which was positive, considering the high risk of rockfall on this route.\n    As we began ascending the North Chimney, my partner stopped after about\n100 feet to switch into climbing shoes. I was wearing my approach shoes, and I felt\ncomfortable continuing in them, as I frequently climb low 5th class in them and\nhad already done this approach in them twice before. As we climbed, my partner\nwas moving faster than me and stayed 10 to 30 feet in front. I noticed that we were\ngoing a different way than I usually go. I didn\u2019t worry about it, because my partner\nis a strong and experienced climber and I generally trust his route-finding skills.\nAbout 200 feet up, I suddenly realized I was kind of stuck. Backing off seemed very\ntenuous. My climbing partner was out of sight, maybe 30 feet ahead of me. I thought\nabout mentioning my predicament, but it felt overly dramatic. After about a minute,\nI decided that I could not stay in the position I was in much longer.\n    I do not remember if I committed to backing off or going forward, but I slipped off.\nI tumbled to climber\u2019s right onto some snow. As recounted by my climbing partners\nafter the incident, I alternated between sliding on my front and back as I fell down\nthe snow, but stayed head up. There was a break in the snow about 30 feet above the\nmouth of the North Chimney that likely slowed my fall.

The fall was fatal. Blanksma and his climbing partner had done the\nstandard North Chimney approach and were on their way to a route on the left side of\nthe Diamond. Broadway is normally traversed by walking unroped, but toward its left\nside the ledge system narrows and slopes more steeply toward the 600- to 800-foot-\nhigh Lower East Face. To reach the start of climbs on this side, a band of fourth-class\n rock approximately 30 feet high must be climbed. Blanksma, still unroped, is believed\nto have fallen from on or near this section, possibly as a result of a loose hold. Dillon\nwas a staff member at the American Alpine Club\u2019s Golden, Colorado, headquarters\nand is much missed by his colleagues, friends, and family.\n\nANALYSIS\nAt least four climbers have died in falls from Broadway. Three of them\u2014including one\nin 2000 and another in 2010\u2014were doing similar unroped approaches up fourth-class\nrock to reach their intended climbs. Although the granite on the Diamond face is\ngenerally very solid, Broadway and the short fourth-class band above the ledge are\ncomprised of weathered alpine rock, with many potentially loose holds. Climbers are\nunderstandably in a hurry to reach their objectives on a busy wall that is prone to\nafternoon thunderstorms, but the history of accidents in this area suggests that roping\nup and belaying the final fourth-class approach would save lives.

        "Incident_Type": "GROUND FALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nBoulder Canyon, Castle Rock\nIn the evening of October 1, professional climber Molly Mitchell (27) attempted\na traditionally protected ascent of Crank It (5.13c/d, a.k.a. Slabio) at the base of\nCastle Rock. The route is bolted, and she had climbed it previously using the\nbolts; now her goal was to lead the route while placing her own protection.\nThe route has two separate cracks, one to the left down low, and then a crux section\nof face climbing to reach the next crack up and to the right. The climb follows this\ncrack to the anchor around 40 feet up. Previously, in 2016, Brad Gobright fell from\nabout 15 to 18 feet up while trying to lead this route on gear, and he ripped the one\npiece he had placed and decked. He broke his back and ankle.\n    Molly got through the crux and fell after her foot slipped about 25 to 30 feet up.\nThe fall ripped out four of the pieces of gear she placed, and she decked. (The gear\nthat pulled out of the crack\u2014from top to bottom\u2014included a small RP nut, a purple\nTotem Cam, a small offset nut, and a medium-size nut.) Fortunately, she landed on\na bouldering pad that she and her partner had laid out for the lower section, just in\ncase. Nonetheless, she ended up with compression fractures in her L2 and L3 verte-\nbrae. No surgery was needed because nothing was displaced, but she had to wear a\nback brace for nine weeks.\n\nANALYSIS\nAfter thinking about this a lot and watching the video of the attempt (which will\neventually be released), I believe that even though I had tested some of the pieces\nof gear before, by falling onto the gear with the bolts clipped as backup, the rope\nwas running in a different spot during my trad attempt. The pro was in two separate\ncracks and the rope was not in a straight line. So that was one factor.\n    Also, the crack is very polished, shallow, and flaring. The pieces are incredibly\nspecific, and sometimes even when they look OK, they will not hold a dynamic fall.\nThe bottom piece that pulled out (the medium nut) was a solid piece of gear, but what\nhappened\u2014and what you will eventually see in the video\u2014is the tension in the rope\nfrom ripping the upper pieces actually lifted this nut up and out of the crack. Had\nthat nut held, I would not have hit the ground.\n    I want to emphasize that my belayer, Tanner, did an absolutely amazing job at\ntrying to take in slack and move backward. There was nothing more he could have\ndone to help the situation. It was a bad fall, and I take full responsibility for putting\nmyself in that position.\n    I believed I had taken my time while rehearsing for this attempt and tried to figure\nout the gear. I had had a near-decking incident at the same spot a week prior, on gear\n                                                        that I had tested yet still ripped, and this\n                                                       made me fully reanalyze my gear for that\n                                                       section.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled Out\nBoulder Canyon, Bell Buttress\nOn August 13, after climbing a few routes at Bell Buttress, I decided to give a redpoint\nattempt at Arms Bazaar (5.12a trad). I had spent two previous sessions on the route:\none in August 2019 and one the previous week. I had the route fairly dialed and felt\nconfident I could send it that day.\n    I racked all my gear in the order I intended to place it and began climbing. After\nclipping the lone bolt on the route, I did a few balancey moves to a good stance. From\nhere, I placed a red Metolius cam in a horizontal crack with the stem facing down-\nward. I clipped into this with a shoulder-length sling. This is a shallow crack, with the\nhead of the cam just fitting in; the fit was tight and the lobes all had great contact,\nthough, so I was not worried about the placement.\n    After a rest, I did a short traverse into the crux. From an undercling, I placed a\nblack Metolius cam (approximately 1.25 inches) in the crack above me. Although the\ncrack flares slightly, the black Metolius fits here decently well, and I had fallen on it\nmultiple times. After placing this cam, I began the crux sequence. I fell with my waist\nat about the height of the top cam. Both of the cams I placed blew out, and I hit the\nground from an estimated 25 feet high. I believe the bolt may have begun to catch\nme slightly as I hit the ground, although I am not sure.\n    My left side took pretty much all of the damage. About 20 to 30 seconds after the\n fall, I began to evaluate my condition with my partner. We confirmed that I was not\nbleeding or deformed anywhere (especially on my skull), so I sat down and just began\nto think and chat with my partner in order to determine my mental state, which was\nnormal, considering the circumstances. I ended up with a bruised left hip, bruised\nleft heel, and a sore thumb. The foam on the right side of my helmet was completely\ncracked. I likely had a mild concussion, but I did not show any symptoms besides\nslight confusion for a minute or so after I fell.\n\nANALYSIS\nFirst of all, I consider myself extremely lucky to have walked away from this fall with\nsuch minimal damage. If circumstances were just slightly different, my injuries would\nhave been much more severe.\n    The protection pulling out was very surprising. I had fallen on the same black\nMetolius placement multiple times, during both prior attempts, and I also considered\nthe red Metolius to be solid, albeit not perfect. The only explanation I can come up\nwith is that the two pieces interacted with each other and the rope in such a way that\nthey helped to torque each other out. The red Metolius was clipped with a shoulder-\nlength sling, and this directed the rope at an estimated 45\u00b0 angle down and left of\nthe black Metolius placement.\n    It is worth noting that there is another possible placement (0.4 size) about eight\ninches under the black Metolius. I had placed a yellow Totem Cam here on some\nprevious burns, but ultimately determined it was unnecessary. Had I placed this piece\nbefore I fell, I likely would not have decked. (I did take a few falls earlier onto the black\nMetolius without the yellow Totem Cam placed, so the Totem was not a necessity in\npreventing a funky interaction between the two Metolius cams.) Although the inter-\naction between pieces when loaded can be difficult to predict, it\u2019s something trad\nclimbers should give a lot of thought to, especially when redpointing, where one has\ntime on the ground or while hangdogging to really analyze each placement and the\nsystem of protection as a whole.\n    Had I not been wearing a helmet, I believe I could have been very seriously injured.\nWhen trad climbing, everything gets harder to predict and control for, and the helmet\nis such an easy precaution to take.

I had not put boot to rock in over six months, owing in part to inactivity\ncompelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. My partner, age 56, and I (69) both began the\nroute fresh off the couch, though we each have long trad climbing histories and much\nexperience on routes far harder than this day\u2019s objective.\n    Starting the second pitch, the route looked unclear to us. I climbed straight up\nfrom our belay stance, following a few chalk marks, and placed two good pieces in the\nfirst 40 feet. A small, shallow pocket accepted a pink Tricam for my highest piece. I\nplaced it carefully and it looked good. I pulled hard on the piece and it flew out easily.\n The accident sites on (A) Second Flatiron (see next page) and (B) First Flatiron (this page).\ndirectly above Boulder, the east faces of these formations are hundreds of feet high.\nThis was disconcerting, but I replaced the Tricam, gave a gentle tug, and hoped for\nthe best. The prospect of positive holds loomed 50 feet higher. Just before reaching\nthem, I placed a small DMM nut.\n    Tired from the tension of this long, dicey lead, I thought exultantly, \u201cI\u2019ve got it in\nthe bag.\u201d I transferred my weight onto a right foot hold, and my foot slipped unexpect-\nedly. My first thoughts on the less-than-vertical face were to keep my feet under me\nand run down the face, waiting to be held by my protection. Quickly, gravity\u2019s accel-\neration exceeded my running ability and I tumbled, completely out of control. I came\nto a stop when I hit the belay ledge after several bounces, landing on my back. The\nrope was slack above me, having \u201ccaught my fall\u201d only enough to rip out my top two\npieces of protection. My top piece somehow came unclipped from the rope during\nmy fall and was located by a party who followed us up the climb\u2014it had landed nearly\nas high and 30 feet to the left of its original placement.\n    My partner and I devised a plan to rappel down a single line from the first anchor\nto the ground.

My most debilitating injury was an extremely pain-\nful left shoulder, though the joint still had full range of motion. I also had abrasions\non the left leg, a seriously bruised right big toe, a sprained right thumb, and gouges\non the top of three fingers of the right hand. My back was spared injury because I\u2019d\nbeen wearing a pack containing a half-empty water bottle that exploded on impact.\nNo head or neck injury.

In the fall of 2020, I started projecting Primate, a 5.13b route at Seal Rock with\na mix of bolt and traditional protection. I visited the route four times and climbed\nit about three times per session. I was very close to sending, and on November 8, I\npaired up with a friend who was visiting from out of town\u2014she was up for trying the\nsame route.\n    The route begins with easier climbing that I used to warm up, as the crag has\nfew moderates. I began the initial 5.11 section, clipping a bolt and then a fixed nut.\nOnce my feet were level with the fixed nut, one foot unexpectedly slipped, causing\na barn-door motion that led to a fall. The nut held for an instant and then ripped out\nof the rock. I fell about 20 feet and landed on my back, directly on the belayer\u2019s rope\nstack. I was unable to breathe for about one minute, but then was able to stand up\nand eventually walk back to the car with my partner. I had narrowly avoided land-\ning on a pointed rock next to the belay.

The rock in this section is very friable, and I believe this\ncontributed both to my foot slipping and to the gear pulling out.\n    Since this incident, I have been assessing fixed gear more thoroughly. I have\ndiscovered open quick links on fixed quickdraws and fixed draws with decade-old\nnylon slings, and I\u2019ve had a hanger detach from a bolt while climbing. I hope others\nwill be more careful in assessing the condition of fixed gear on their climbs, even if\nthey have done a route a dozen times. (Source: Patrick Hardy.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Distraction, No Stopper Knot\nClear Creek Canyon, Little Eiger\nOn August 10, I got off work at 5 p.m. and my partner and I set out to Little Eiger,\na crag we had never visited. I knew from reading some route descriptions that we\nwould need a 70-meter rope and at least 16 draws. We first climbed Busch Gardens\n(5.10), directly above the approach trail, and I took a few falls near the top. It was\nobvious that I was tired from work, which I feel contributed to what happened next.\n     My partner top-roped Busch Gardens and I belayed. We had forgotten the rope bag,\nwhich I use as a safety tool; I always tie a triple barrel knot and then overhand it around\nthe red marker on the rope tarp. This was the first deviation from our normal practice.\n     We finished up Busch Gardens and moved onto Is Our Children Learning? (5.9+)\nat the far right end of the crag. I coiled the rope directly into my pack and did not tie\na stopper knot, though I didn\u2019t think about it at the time.\n     The route starts with a large overhang protected by a bolt, leaning out over a small,\neroding landing zone, which sits above a steep, rocky hillside that falls to the road about\n80 feet below. As I belayed my partner\u2019s lead climb, I noticed the middle mark on the\nrope pass through my Grigri, but it did not pass the first bolt before she reached the\nanchor so I didn\u2019t think too much about it. My partner was planning to clean the draws\noff the route, which I figured would allow for enough extra rope to safely lower her.\n     Given the arching nature of the route, cleaning the pitch was more difficult than\nnormal and I was distracted with trying to help her. When she was about four feet\nabove the ground, I heard the horrific sound of the rope snapping through the Grigri.\nI tried to grab for the rope, which sent me tumbling after her down the steep hillside.\nWe rolled about 40 feet and came to a stop on a tiny shrub. I am sure going the rest\nof the way would have resulted in a much worse outcome. We were extremely lucky\nand were left with bad bruises and some good cuts, but nothing major.\n\nANALYSIS\nTying a knot and closing the system would have prevented this entire scenario. In\nmy studies of avalanche accidents, the human factor is something all the experts talk\nabout. This was not a breakdown of knowledge or systems\u2014this was human error. Was\nit simple complacency? Was it a lack of focus? Stupidity, fatigue, arrogance? Most likely\nall of these and yet none of them. The best single explanation I have come to is that we\nfailed to follow through our system/safety checks 100 percent. My takeaway for the\nfuture\u2014and the takeaway I hope to convey to the community\u2014is to never skip a full\nsafety check before every route. (Source: Anonymous climber.)\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This route and others at this crag require a full 70-meter rope to\nlower safely. Although it was not a critical issue in this incident, dynamic ropes often\nvary from their stated length, and with age they can shrink by up to 10 percent of their\ninitial length (that\u2019s more than 22 feet on a 70-meter rope). Moreover, according to\nPetzl, ropes may shrink unevenly, meaning a middle marker may become inaccurate\nover time. All of which reinforces the climber\u2019s main point: Close the system and do a\nfull safety review with your partner\u2014harness, tie-in, stopper knot, belay set-up, and a\nplan for cleaning the anchor\u2014before every climb.",

I\u2019ve climbed at the Red\nseveral times, and though it was my partner\u2019s first time here, he has climbed and\nbelayed plenty of steep routes. My background is multi-pitch trad, and his is all sport.\nWe are about the same weight.\n    On September 8, my partner led The Fury (5.11c sport) at Bibliothek in the Muir.\nI was tired and didn\u2019t feel like climbing the route, so we decided he would clean it\nwhile lowering off. He was clipped into the belayer\u2019s side of the rope with a quickdraw\n(a.k.a. tramming), as is standard practice when cleaning overhanging routes. At the\nlast draw he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to swing,\u201d so I weighted the rope as much as I could\nbefore he cleaned the lowest draw.\n    I was prepared to swing a few feet, but when he removed the last draw from the\nroute, he was still clipped into my side of the rope. This caused both of us to swing\nabout 20 feet backward. I slammed into a small boulder lying on the ground and\nthen hit a tree. I made contact with one leg just above the ankle, and I think I hit my\nfoot too. It all hurt right away. I was able to stand and walk slowly, so we hiked out.\n    I could barely walk for two weeks, and it took months before I was back to climb-\ning. It was not fractured, but likely a severe bone bruise and tendonitis. (Source:\nAmanda Friedman.)\n\nANALYSIS\nCleaning the last draw while lowering from an\noverhanging route is always potentially hazard-\nous, as the climber generally will swing out from\nthe wall. To avoid pulling the belayer into a swing\nas well, the cleaning climber should completely\ndisconnect from the belayer\u2019s side of the rope\nbefore letting go from the wall. The belayer can\nrelocate to a good position to brace for the swing\nwhen the climber unclips the lowest bolt.\n    Another option is to leave the first draw on\nthe route while cleaning and then remove it from\nthe ground with a stick clip. (There are video\ntutorials online for most types of stick clips.)\nMuir Valley even has a few stick clips available\nfor climbers to borrow, located underneath the\nawning by the parking lot.

She had veered left of the bolt line, because she thought\nshe was in the fall zone of a climber on the crux of the adjacent route (the routes share\na start). Instead of climbing back down and right to get in sequence on the route, she\ntook an unannounced fall. She swung into the wall hard, resulting in a pilon fracture.\n    On November 28, a female climber with over five years of experience took a\ncontrolled lead fall on The King Lives On (5.10b sport) at the Gallery in the PMRP. She\nhit the wall with her leg extended, resulting in a pilon fracture.\n    On November 30, a female climber was climbing Omaha Beach (5.14a sport) at the\nMotherlode. Her foot slipped, causing her leg to go behind the rope. While correcting\nher leg position during the fall, she inverted. Although the route is overhanging, she\nimpacted the wall, injuring her sacrum. (Sources: Erik Kloeker, Wolfe County Search\nand Rescue, eyewitness, Mountain Project, and anonymous climber.)\n\nANALYSIS\nSome of these injuries may have resulted from poor or unlucky positioning by the\nclimber or inadequate awareness while falling or preparation to absorb the impact.\nOthers might have been avoided with a softer catch by the belayer.\n     The arrest of a leader fall is a dynamic situation. Before the leader leaves the\nground, the climber and belayer need to consider and discuss their weight differ-\nence, the properties of the rope (stretch/elongation), and any potential hazards of a\nfall on that route. During the climb, a skilled belayer will adjust the amount of slack in\nthe system, their position, and their planned reaction to a fall to give an appropriate\ncatch. (See \u201cDynamic Belaying\u201d on next page.) The falling climber should be actively\nspotting their landing and preparing to absorb the impact of the fall with their legs.\n     Falling is part of climbing, and good partners practice their falling and belaying,\njust like other climbing skills. Consider practice falls at the gym or at a safe location\noutside, starting with falls at or below a bolt and gradually taking longer falls (when\nhigh enough on a route to be safe). This is a great time for partners to discuss their\npersonal preferences, gauge the effects of weight differences, learn the characteristics\nof the climbing rope, learn how belay adjustments affect the catch, and discuss situa-\ntions where a softer or tighter belay would be more appropriate.

Both are experienced climbers. Ed led the pitches on the Watchtower and\nthe first two pitches of Silver Foxes. The two then decided to do the alternative third\npitch of Silver Foxes (5.6) instead of the standard final pitch of 5.10a/b. This pitch\nstarts on a large ledge where a belay anchor is not needed. The variation appeared\nas though it was not climbed frequently.\n    At about 1:30 p.m., Eric started to lead. About eight feet above the belay, he came\nto a block that, after testing, seemed solid. Using the block as a hold, he went for the\nnext hold with his other hand and the block pulled loose. Eric pushed the block away\nfrom Ed as he fell, and, having placed no pro, dropped to the belay ledge. Landing on\na sharp rock, he suffered a deep ten-inch laceration on his right calf and fractured\nhis fibula. He tried standing up, but realized the injuries were too severe to get back\ndown without additional help.\n    Ed, who is a paramedic, bandaged Erik\u2019s leg with climbing tape and webbing and\nmoved him into the shade, anchoring him to a large tree. At 2 p.m., Ed gave Eric some\nfood and water and left to call for help. By 2:35 p.m., Ed was at the Lava Lake emergency\ncall-box on Highway 191 and placed a 911 call. A party of two overheard Ed phoning\nfor help and offered to climb up to Eric while Ed waited at the parking lot.

Eric was spotted by a Gallatin County Search and Rescue helicop-\nter at approximately 4 p.m. and was short-hauled from the site in a litter.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe two climbers noticed that the variation seemed infrequently climbed, which\ncould have alerted them to the possibility of loose rock and the need for greater\ncare with the holds.

In late season, the Snowbridge is often melted out, but earlier in\nthe year, an ice axe and crampons will make this passage more secure. Jay and Jared\nwere inexperienced for a route of this difficulty and carried no technical equipment.\n    Fixed rappel anchors should always be carefully assessed and tested before trust-\ning one\u2019s life to them. In this case, a firm test-push might have revealed the insta-\nbility of the boulder and prevented the tragic incident. Note that the first person to\nreach a rappel anchor should inspect and test the anchor setup before clipping to the\nanchor; if necessary, this test should be performed while protected by a temporary\nanchor or while still clipped to the ropes from the previous rappel.

        "Details_Factors": "Beartooth Mountains, Granite Peak\nOn July 2, Emma Ely (25), Randy Smersh (36), and I (Zach Eiten, 28), all experienced\nmountaineers, set out to climb the Notch Couloir route on the north face of Gran-\n ite Peak (12,799 feet), Montana\u2019s\nhigh point. The Notch Couloir is\ndescribed as \u201csteep snow followed\nby a 5.4 ridge to the summit.\u201d We\napproached via Huckleberry\nCreek, bivouacked between\nAvalanche and Cold lakes, and on\nJuly 3 we were underway around 4\na.m. The boulder fields surround-\ning Avalanche Lake slowed\nus significantly, and when we\nreached the cirque below Granite\nPeak, Randy decided to split off\nand climb the standard (east ridge)\nroute via the Tempest-Granite\n                                      The north face of Granite Peak showing the Notch Couloir\nsaddle. We maintained contact\n                                      and the accident site on the north ridge. The east ridge is\nthroughout the day via walkie- in the left foreground. Gallatin County Search and Rescue\ntalkies. Emma and I started up our\nroute and simul-climbed most of the couloir with only a couple of belays.\n    At the saddle atop the couloir it began to snow, and we paused in case it became\nnecessary to bail. Conditions in the Notch Couloir had been deteriorating as the\ndaytime temperature increased (the forecast called for temperatures in the 30s to\nlow 40s Fahrenheit), and we had seen some very small sloughs and minor rockfall,\nso we felt inclined to wait for the storm to pass rather than bail down the couloir.\n    As the squall subsided, we assessed the north ridge, which was more iced up and\nsnow-packed than hoped, and opted for a line just to the east of the saddle in mixed\ncondition. I started up a gully that felt like M3, with loose rock; I was able to place\nonly a single nut and a number 1 cam. At the top of the pitch, I slung a refrigerator-\nsize block and placed a 0.75 cam in the crack formed by the intersection of the block\nand the main face. I knew this belay was insecure, so I didn\u2019t weight the anchor; I had\nonly a six- to eight-inch-wide ledge to stand on. It was around 1 p.m.\n    As I began pulling up the ropes to belay Emma, a microwave-size rock fell spon-\ntaneously from the gully above me. This large block and ensuing cascade of rocks\ncollided with my anchor block and launched it off the edge. Instantly I was falling.\nThankfully, the pitch below formed a series of steps, with vertical sections sepa-\nrated by ledges; I was able to arrest my fall on one of these ledges. Had I not done\nso, I would have fallen another 20 feet or more before being arrested by the cam I\nplaced on the ascent.\n    One of the blocks had crushed my left foot during the barrage. I managed to place\na bomber nut and sling a good horn that allowed Emma to lower me to her anchor.\nAfter confirming my toes were likely broken, I established radio contact with Randy,\nwho was descending to the basin after retreating from his route, and asked him to\ntry to contact search and rescue.\n    Emma and I began rappelling the Notch Couloir. It took six 70-meter rappels to\nreach the snow apron at the base. My foot was quite numb at this point, which allowed\nme to cautiously glissade and heel-step down the snowfield. We reached snowline\n around sunset, and at 3 a.m. we arrived back at our base camp.\n   Meanwhile, Randy had encountered a party at Huckleberry Lake who used their\nGarmin inReach to initiate a rescue. Around 7 a.m., Two Bear Air, a philanthropic\nrescue crew, arrived in a helicopter but were unable to land due to strong winds.\nGallatin County SAR, on standby, responded shortly after and was able to land its\nhelicopter near our camp. I was flown to Absarokee, Montana, where an ambulance\ntook me to a clinic for X-rays. I had multiple broken bones in four of the five toes on\nmy left foot.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe natural rockfall was very unfortunate. I cannot say what would have happened\nhad I remained anchored when the rocks fell onto my position, but at the end of the\nday I made the mistake of settling for a subpar anchor. The slung block and the cam\nplaced between it and the wall both failed when the block dislodged, so the anchor\nwas not actually redundant. I could have pounded my ice tools in cracks or turf and/\nor tried to excavate a secondary feature to find protection that would have affixed\nme to the mountain as well as to the boulder.\n    Another factor was the lack of solid freeze on mixed terrain. The fact that we\u2019d\nbeen slowed throughout the day (the boulder field, waiting out the brief snowstorm)\nmeant the temperature was higher than it would have been if I\u2019d reached this stance\nearlier in the day. Every now and again while mixed climbing you reach an anchor\nposition with less than ideal gear, and massive blocks or relatively sketchy horns\nbecome your friends. However, this is generally when everything is frozen over in\nlate fall or winter, and in the afternoon in early July, Granite Peak was far from solidly\nfrozen. (Source: Zach Eiten.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Downclimbing 4th-Class Terrain\nRed Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Oak Creek Canyon\nOn October 31 at approximately 7 a.m., my climbing partner and I set out to climb\nSolar Slab in Oak Creek Canyon. At about 8:30 a.m. we arrived at the base of a large\ngully in the Lower Solar Slab area. [Editor\u2019s Note: Solar Slab, a classic multi-pitch 5.6,\nis generally accessed by climbing the Solar Slab Gully, which has about 500 feet of low\n5th-class terrain. The gully leads to a large ledge, which serves as the start for numerous\nclimbs, including the actual route Solar Slab.]\n    By 10 a.m. I had led three rope lengths and my partner had led half a rope length,\ntotaling approximately 650 feet. At this point, we realized the climb we had done\nwas not aligning with the route description for the Solar Slab Gully. We decided we\nmust have gone off route at some point and chose to retreat back down the gully\nwe had climbed.\n    We had executed two rappels when we encountered 25 to 30 feet of 4th-class\nterrain. To save time, we opted to downclimb this section. At about 11 a.m., while at\nthe top of the downclimb, I slipped and fell the entire length of the 4th-class section,\nlanding on a large flat area below. According to my climbing partner, I hit a bush and\nthen landed on my face/head. I was wearing a helmet, which exploded upon impact.\nI was briefly unconscious, and when I came to, I was barely able to communicate. My\ncondition worsened with time.\n    My climbing partner immediately contacted search and rescue, and they arrived\nabout three hours after the fall. I got to the hospital at 3:20 p.m. I had sustained a\nmajor brain hemorrhage, multiple skull fractures, a fractured distal radius in my right\nwrist, and a dislocated pinkie. Six months later, I had fully recovered, outside of some\nloss of right wrist mobility.\n\nANALYSIS\nSeveral factors contributed to the accident. First and foremost, we had gotten off\nroute from the start. We arrived in Las Vegas late the prior evening and hadn\u2019t closely\nstudied the approach to Solar Slab Gully, the relative location of the gully to Solar Slab\nitself, nor the features on each of the pitches on Solar Slab Gully. Had we done this\npreparation, we would have either gotten on the correct climb or quickly determined\nwe were on the wrong climb and retreated sooner.\n    On the descent, we should have continued rappelling down the gully instead of\nopting to downclimb the 4th-class section. Part of what pushed us to downclimb\nwas that we wanted to descend the gully quickly, so we would have time to find our\nway to the Solar Slab climb.\n    Another factor that contributed to the accident was confirmation bias. I was used\nto downclimbing a 30-foot section of 4th-class terrain at my home crag at Seneca\nRocks, West Virginia. This gave me false confidence in high-consequence terrain.\n(Source: Anonymous report from the climber.)",

        "Incident_Type": "NEW HAMPSHIRE\nROCKFALL",
        "Details_Factors": "Severed Rope\nWhite Mountains, Cannon Cliff\nOn September 20, Ben Kessel (34) and Emma Leigh Donahue (30s) were climbing\nMoby Grape (8 pitches, 5.8 PG-13) on Cannon Cliff. Both were active within the MIT\nOuting Club and experienced rock climbers. Conditions were windy but pleasant, and\nthere had been no rain for days. As is common on summer and early fall weekends,\nmultiple parties were climbing the route; Ben and Emma were the first, and highest,\nparty. Kevin Soleil and Bill Moriarty were climbing as a separate party just below and\nleft of Ben and Emma throughout the day and witnessed this accident.\n    Ben had climbed the route before and was informally mentoring Emma, who\nwas new to Cannon. They swapped leads and most of the climb went uneventfully,\nalthough they did have some difficulty managing rope drag at places and Emma took\none short fall. Around 3:30 p.m., Emma reached the top of pitch seven after taking a\nslightly different route than the most commonly climbed line. (The upper pitches of\nmany climbs at Cannon present route-finding challenges as the angle gradually less-\nens.) At about 3:45 p.m., as she was belaying Ben up to her stance, a block estimated\nto be the size of a refrigerator became dislodged about 50 feet below the belay and\nfell directly toward Ben as he approached from below. The rock slid over their single\nrope, severing it and knocking Ben off the route into a long free fall.\n    At the time of the incident, Kevin had just reached the top of Kurt\u2019s Corner, an\nalternate finish about 75 feet to the left. Kevin heard Ben shout \u201cRock!\u201d and he got a\nbrief glancing view of the rock falling. Emma, Bill, and another climbing party below\nwho overheard the incident promptly called 911. New Hampshire Fish and Game and\nPemigewasset Valley SAR personnel were subsequently notified and began their\nresponse toward both the base of the cliff and the summit area.\n    After the rockfall stopped, Kevin quickly belayed Bill to his location and they\ntraversed to Emma\u2019s belay stance to provide assistance. Together, the three care-\nfully rappelled down to search for and try to help Ben. They took care to avoid the\nimmediate rockfall site to prevent dislodging any additional material. At 5:30 p.m.,\nEmma located Ben on a ledge about 150 feet below the rockfall site among some small,\ndense spruce trees. Kevin soon also reached this site. Ben had not survived the fall.\n    Kevin, Emma, and Bill ascended their ropes, and responders reached the scene\nat 6:15 p.m., with only about 30 minutes of daylight remaining. Given the impend-\ning darkness, they focused on assisting the uninjured climbers to the top of the cliff\nbefore night fell and temperatures dropped. Early the next morning, responders\nfrom New Hampshire Fish and Game, Mountain Rescue Service, and Pemi Valley SAR\ncompleted the recovery.\n\nANALYSIS\nCannon is a large alpine cliff subject to both climber-triggered and spontaneous\nrockfall. The current Cannon guidebook (Sykes, 2017) describes the recent history\n of specific rockfalls and climber accidents in detail (pp. 180\u2013186). In 1968, a climber\ndied while placing a piton behind a block, causing it to fall onto him. In 1988, two\nclimbers were killed when the rock supporting their belay anchors failed, causing\nthem to fall to the ground. In 2006, a climber was severely injured when a block he\nwas standing on released and caused a long fall (see ANAC 2007). While spontaneous\nnatural rockfall is common, the only known incident of natural rockfall resulting in\na climber injury was in the early 1990s, when massive rockfall starting high on the\ncliff shattered and reached climbers on the talus slopes far below.\n    Since neither Emma nor Kevin had a clear view of the block as it started falling, the\nimmediate cause cannot be determined. However, climber-triggered rockfall cannot\nbe ruled out. Cultivating an awareness of potential loose blocks and conditions that\nincrease rockfall hazard is a must for those choosing to climb on Cannon and similar\nalpine crags. Early season is particularly hazardous, due to springtime wetness and\nfreeze-thaw cycling, as is climbing immediately after heavy rain. Getting off route can\nincrease the exposure to loose rock. Hollow sounding rocks, newly exposed sharp,\nclean edges, or gaps should raise suspicion. In general, avoid pulling on, standing on,\nplacing protection around, or allowing ropes to drag against any suspicious rocks.\n    The hazard of rockfall severing the climbing rope could be somewhat mediated\nby using double-rope technique (two half ropes); skillful use of half ropes may also\ngive the leader more options to bypass an area of suspicious rock.\n    This incident is a sobering reminder of the rockfall hazard on even the most popu-\nlar Cannon routes. It\u2019s also important to remember that climbing below other parties\non multi-pitch routes exposes climbers to a high risk of human-triggered rockfall\nand other falling objects.

        "Details_Factors": "\nMonhonk Preserve\nIn 2020 the Mohonk Preserve experienced a statistically anomalous year due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For two months, the land was closed to visitors and no access\npasses were sold. When the preserve was open, there was a significant increase in\nnon-climbing day passes. Meanwhile, the access passes that allow climbing saw a\nmarked decrease, especially from the shutdown until October (when the numbers\nreturned to pre-pandemic levels.) These changes are reflected in the report below.\n    Mohonk Preserve rangers responded to 11 climbing-related accidents in 2020. (By\ncontrast, there were 22 reported accidents in 2019 and 23 in 2018.) There was one\nfatality. The other accidents resulted in two head injuries, five lower-leg injuries, one\npelvic fracture, and assorted minor lacerations. One rappelling climber was bitten by\na copperhead and was evacuated after safely getting themselves to the carriage road.\nFive climbing incidents required technical rescue, and two of those were high-angle.\nRangers were also deployed seven other times for technical rescue in non-climbing\naccidents from difficult terrain.\n    The fatality occurred on the route Triple Bulges, a 5.6 route in the Trapps. The\nleader was approximately 90 feet above the Guide\u2019s Wall Ledge, and had placed\nseveral pieces of protection along their route. Here, at one of the crux sections over\na small roof, the leader placed at least one more camming device (it was recovered\nafter the incident and did not appear to have been clipped to the rope.) The leader fell\nfrom this point, and several camming devices pulled out of the rock, failing to arrest\nthe fall before the leader struck a ledge 20 feet above their belayer. Nearby climb-\ners and rangers responded quickly, but the resulting technical work was a recovery.\n    In two other accidents, lead climbers had protection pieces fail in falls, but were\nprotected from more serious injury by lower elements of the system. One leader\nplaced a camming unit and then fell before clipping it. The quick actions of their\nbelayer and the lower pieces minimized the injuries sustained (see report below).\n    One leader fell a short distance at the start of the first pitch of Annie Oh! (5.8+) in\nthe Trapps and suffered a tibia/fibula fracture. Despite the climber being close to the\nground, responding rangers devised a high-angle lower to get the seriously injured\n person down from a ledge only accessible by 4th-class movement.\n   A rappeler attempting to access the anchor bolts at the top of Bunny (5.4) used an\nunknown method to attach their rope to a small pitch pine tree on top of the cliff. (The\nanchor bolts are 20 feet below the walkable clifftop.) When the rappeler weighted\nthe system, the rope unraveled from the tree and they fell 15 feet to a sloping ledge\nabove the bolts (and far off the ground.) Rangers completed a high-angle rescue to\nreach the climber and lower them to the carriage road.\n   One climber was involved in a non-climbing accident that resulted in severe head\nand back injuries when the hammock they were attempting to enter broke apart. The\nhammock had been suspended from trees over a steep talus field. Mohonk Preserve\nrules do not allow hammocks to be attached to trees.\n\nANALYSIS\nAccidents on the Mohonk Preserve dropped 50 percent from the previous climb-\ning season. There are several theoretical explanations for this. Perhaps there were\nfewer climbers overall (as noted in the statistics that are mentioned above). Perhaps\nthe climbers who decided to come to the Preserve were more conservative in their\nobjectives and risk management or they represented a more experienced segment\nof the climbing population at large.\n    One notable observation is that a majority of the incidents in 2020 were the result\nof climber error. Absent are reports of rockfall-related accidents, and there was only\none event that involved environmental dangers (a snakebite). Also absent from years\npast are stranded climbers who found themselves unprepared or off route.\n    This overview of the incidents that occurred in the Mohonk Preserve serves as\na reminder to stay up to date on the variety of skills necessary to be safe, even in an\narea with very convenient access.

I placed two or three\ngood cams in the first 20 feet of the climb. Above that, I saw a couple of places I could\nhave placed cams, not far above my highest piece, but decided to move higher before\nplacing another one. Looking up, I could see horizontal corrugations, but upon reaching\nthem they turned out not to be deep enough to accept cams.

        "Details_Factors": "Protection Pulled Out\nPilot Mountain State Park\nOn August 1 a party of three, Michael Hall (26), M. Johnson (26), and D. Jones (28),\nwere climbing Cowboys and Heroes (5.7), a 40-foot route in the Foreign Trade Zone\narea. Hall was leading the route and fell from a harder variation near the top of the\nclimb after he weighted his highest piece and it pulled out. In the resulting ground\nfall, Hall suffered open fractures of the tibia and fibula on his right leg, a laceration\nto the left leg, and a fractured sternum.\n     Hall described what happened: We arrived at Pilot Mountain around 9:30 a.m. and\ngot on a trad climb to warm up, and followed with some top-roping and projecting\ntwo 5.10s. Around 11:20 a.m., we moved to a new area and I decided to attempt to\nonsight Cowboys and Heroes.\n    I placed my first piece at around 10 feet in a horizontal crack. The next 10 feet\nof climbing leads to a ledge 18 to 20 feet from ground. The second placement was\na blue number 1 TCU, also in a horizontal crack. I tested this piece by grabbing the\n sling and giving it two quick jerks. The final portion of\nthe climb has a number of finishes. Rather than take\nthe 5.7 finish as I had intended, I started working up a\nvertical crack (5.10).\n    At this point, with my feet approximately 25 to\n30 feet from the ground, I started to get pumped. I\nplaced a clearly under-cammed (tipped out) number\n2 cam, and as the pump intensified, I began looking\nfor a placement to back it up. While trying to grab a\nnumber 3 cam from my rack, my arms began to give\nout. I grabbed the draw attached to the number 2 cam\nto help me place the larger piece, but this resulted\nin the number 2 cam pulling out. As I fell, the blue\nTCU also pulled from the rock. I fell past the ledge,\nhitting my left knee on the way down, and landed on\nthe ground with both my feet taking the full force of\nthe fall, before falling backward and coming to a rest\non my back and side.\n    One of my partners tried to immobilize me while\nthe other called 911. A climbing guide and off-duty fire-\nman were in the area and reached me within a few\n                                                            The route Cowboys and Heroes\nminutes.

Evan McKearn\n\n\nANALYSIS\nHall noted: \u201cI believe that not placing additional gear, climbing on rock that had\nmoisture and was dirty, and not staying on route were the factors contributing to\nmy fall. By downclimbing five feet or so [to regroup], I may have been able to prevent\nthe fall. Luckily, I was wearing a helmet. A life-changing accident can happen on an\neasy climb as quickly as it can on a hard one.\u201d\n    Many climbers opt to top-rope the traditionally protected routes at Pilot Moun-\ntain because bands of poor rock exist throughout the climbing area. In addition, the\nroutes are often quite short, making a ground fall a real possibility when cam or nut\nplacements fail. (Sources: Michael Hall and the Editors.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Weather, Seldom-Climbed Route\nHanging Rock State Park, Moore\u2019s Wall, Sentinel Buttress\nOn May 27, following a two-week period of heavy rain, a pair of very experienced\nclimbers planned to do the popular route Break on Through (5.10a) on the Circus\nWall of Sentinel Buttress. The route begins from a ledge approximately 60 feet up an\nadjacent wall; to reach the start, climbers ascend easy 5th-class terrain on the Egg\nWall or the Sentinel Chimney. On this day, both of the usual approaches were soak-\ning wet with runoff. However, the climbers noted a large dry streak on the Egg Wall,\n along or near a seldom-traveled route known as Scrambled Eggs (approximately 5.6).\nAbove them, Break on Through was almost completely dry and judged to be climbable.\n    Climber 1 led the pitch to the ledge and built a solid belay anchor. Climber 2 was\nfollowing the pitch, approximately 30 feet off the ground, when he reached a rounded\nfin of rock that he needed for a handhold to clear a small overhang. The hold appeared\nto be an integral part of the wall, but since it was clear that the recent rains had loos-\nened a lot of holds, Climber 2 tested it by partially weighting the hold overhead and\nbouncing with his body weight. He felt some movement in the rock, tested it again,\nand felt no further movement\u2014since he was on easy ground, he judged it was safe to\ncontinue. As he moved off his stance, the rock gave way and a piece approximately\n14 inches square and weighing about 25 pounds hit him on the head (he was wearing\na helmet), knee, and finally on the top of his right foot.\n    Despite his foot injury, Climber 2 was able to traverse about 50 feet to a rappel\nstation on an adjacent route, protecting the traverse using the gear on his harness.\nClimber 1 followed the improvised traverse, and then both climbers rappelled and\nhiked out. An X-ray revealed a fracture of the first metatarsal. (Source: Climber 2.)\n\nANALYSIS\nSubstantial wet weather or freeze-thaw cycles may cause seemingly solid holds to\nwork loose. These experienced climbers understood the potential impact of heavy\nrain on the variable quartzite at Moore\u2019s Wall; they altered their usual approach to\navoid wet rock, and they tested suspect holds. After feeling the hold move when he\ntested it the first time, the climber might have tried to find an alternative line. Yet\nthis might have led him onto other seldom-climbed terrain, with other loose holds.\n     \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget at popular areas, where the classics have 40 years of traffic\nand little loose rock, that wandering even just a few feet off the beaten path can lead\nto a first-ascent-like experience, in terms of rock quality,\u201d Climber 2 said. \u201cWe often\nfree solo a clean and well-traveled easy section of this wall as an approach pitch, so\nit\u2019s tempting to treat the whole wall as a foregone conclusion. That led to a case of\nexperienced climbers not adjusting expectations to current conditions.\u201d (Sources:\nClimber 2 and the Editors.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Carabiner Unclipped After Stick-Clipping\nLinville Gorge, Hawksbill Mountain\nOn June 14, I was belaying a very experienced climber who was attempting to stick-clip\nthrough the crux on a route. The climber clipped the second bolt from the ground and\nthen began to pull up on the belay strand of the rope while I pulled in slack. I heard a\nmetallic ping sound and watched the climber fall. I dove off a ledge to take up slack, and\nthe climber came very close to a ground fall, but ended up with only some abrasions.\n    The dogbone on the quickdraw had somehow detached itself from the carabiner\nclipped to the second bolt. I went up and retrieved the carabiner and it looked normal,\nand the dogbone looked A-OK as well. My only conclusion is that while the climber\nwas going hand over hand up the rope, he inadvertently shifted the draw into a kind\nof \u201cback clip\u201d position in which the nylon dogbone could open the gate of the cara-\nbiner and work free. (Source: Anonymous belayer.)\n ANALYSIS\nStick-clipping is a great way to protect the opening moves of a climb or to get a\ntop-rope up on a hard sport climb so you can work out the moves. But this also can\ncreate an illusion of safety, and it\u2019s important not to be complacent about clipping\nbolts or double-checking the results.

        "Details_Factors": "Excess Slack, Fatigue, Missed Clip\nMelrose Mountain Climbing Park\nMelrose Mountain is a relatively new climbing area, near the South Carolina border,\nthat hosts top-rope, trad, mixed, and sport routes (5.7\u20135.11). On December 19, Jesse\nWatson (32) and his partner EC (31) were finishing their day by climbing Feelin\u2019 Good\n(5.10a), a 50-foot, five-bolt sport route. Jesse was leading and had clipped the first three\nbolts on the route without difficulty. At the fourth bolt, he struggled to clip and kept\ndropping the rope. At this point, he knew he \u201cwas going to fall\u201d and noted that he was\nhigh enough on the route that a ground fall was not expected to be an issue. He lost his\ngrip and fell approximately 30 to 35 feet to the ground. He was not wearing a helmet.\n    His belayer, using a Grigri Plus, had given him slack to make the clip and was unable\nto pull in the slack and arrest his fall before he impacted the large boulder beneath\nthe climb, hitting feet first. (The rope didn\u2019t catch him until he came to rest in a seated\nposition.) A paramedic, Jesse did a quick self-assessment and found an open fracture\nof his left tibia/fibula and a suspected fractured right ankle.\n\nANALYSIS\nJesse described what he had learned from this incident: \u201cI think what it ultimately\ncame down to was complacency. I am very comfortable leading 5.10 sport, and my\npartner and I had become too comfortable with the fact that I don\u2019t fall. I usually climb\npretty fast, so I had requested extra slack from my belayer so as to not get hung up.\nThe additional slack for the clip, the distance my belayer was standing from the face\ndue to the boulder below the route, and fatigue were all factors in this accident. I was\nnot wearing a helmet and was extremely lucky to \u2018walk away\u2019 with the injuries I did.\u201d\n    When belayers position themselves anywhere but directly under the climb, it\u2019s\nnot just the climber at risk\u2014the belayer can be pulled into the wall by the forces of\na fall, causing serious injuries. When the topography forces you to belay more than\na few feet away from an ideal position, consider a ground anchor. (Sources: Jesse\nWatson and the Editors.)\n\nANOTHER GROUND FALL AT MELROSE: In August, a climber experienced a ground\nfall on a route next to Feelin\u2019 Good. He did the first few moves of Something to BRAG About\n(5.11- trad) and placed a medium cam in an undercling. Deciding he couldn\u2019t make the next\nmoves, he asked to rest on the cam, but as soon as he weighted it, the bottom of the flake\nsnapped off and he fell to the ground. \u201cLuckily my belayer spotted me and kept my body\nfrom landing weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI had just a scrape on my arm.\u201d The climber said he failed\nto notice a small crack in the rock near his placement, and that he now plans to climb\nonly sport routes at this crag because of the rock quality.

In waist-deep snow, he\nattempted to use the Find My Car app on his phone to guide him toward the parking\narea. However, he still had a long way to go in rugged terrain, and when his phone\nwas nearly out of life, he used the last of his battery to call 911 at around 8:30 p.m.\n    While he waited for help, the man dug a snow cave behind a big rock and lined it with\nfir boughs from the only tree in his area. He attempted to light a fire, but was unsuc-\ncessful in the wind and driving rain. He conserved the little food he had and waited.\n    Around 10 p.m., seven members of Portland Mountain Rescue (PMR) assembled at\nthe day lodge at Timberline. It was decided to send a team of six to the top of the Palmer\nski lift and head out from there to rescue the man, using the GPS coordinates from his\nphone. Travel was slow due to the deep snow. As they neared the man\u2019s location, the\nteam started doing whistle blasts. On the second whistle, they got an answer back.\n    He was found at 2 a.m. at about the 6,000-foot level in Paradise Park, west of Zig\nZag Canyon. He does not recall the rescuers finding him. In a state of severe hypo-\nthermia, he had removed much of his clothing (a phenomenon known as \u201cparadoxi-\ncal undressing\u201d). He was given a high-calorie paste and hot liquid, along with warm\nclothing and a bivy bag, and the team built snow walls to block the wind.\n    The patient was unable to walk, and a helicopter evacuation was unlikely due to\nintermittent whiteout conditions and a projected 2.5-hour wait for the flight crew.\nThe decision was made to drag a litter carrying the patient about 3,700 vertical feet\n down to the road. Additional rescuers from various teams made their way to the\nparty to assist, and everyone finally made it to the Paradise Park trailhead at 2 p.m.\non Saturday, 12 hours after the initial contact. The snowboarder was transferred to\na waiting ambulance, which took him to Mountain Medical, where he was rewarmed\nand treated with IV fluids.\n\nANALYSIS\nGetting an early start (often before daybreak) is usually necessary to complete a\nsuccessful climb of Mt. Hood. Sticking to his original timeline and plan for not pursu-\ning a summit, this climber may have avoided this incident. Carrying a compass or\nfully charged GPS and preprogrammed coordinates could have helped him find his\nway down to Timberline Lodge, even in whiteout conditions. He also had inadequate\nclothing, food, and water to survive an unexpected night out. However, the patient did\nwell to stop and seek shelter and to call 911 before his phone died, thus giving rescu-\ners his location coordinates. These decisions undoubtedly saved his life.

He had\nplanned to ski Mt. Hood and Mt. Shasta en route to a job posting in Northern Cali-\nfornia. After a rapid climb to the summit via the Pearly Gates, Miller chose Old Chute\nfor his descent. It looked steep and he could feel the snow was hardpacked, but it\nseemed within his ability.\n    After starting down by side-slipping, he launched a jump turn but lost his edges\non the icy snow and began to slide. Miller slid and tumbled down the chute, hitting\nsome rocks, and fell into an open fumarole, a crevasse-like opening in the snow and\nice through which volcanic gases emerge.\n    Luckily, onlookers had seen his fall and ran over to the fumarole from the Hogs-\nback.

My parents were visiting me in Bend for the holidays, and we had gone\nto Smith to check out the park and get in some climbing. My wife, who, like me, is an\nexperienced climber, was not available that day, so I decided to have my father belay,\nfiguring a Grigri would lock in a lead-fall situation. I gave my father, who was a complete\nnovice as a belayer, a quick overview of how to use a Grigri 2. I warmed up on one route,\nthen set up a top-rope on a harder adjacent route. On the harder route, I hung on the\ntop-rope several times to demonstrate to my father how to hold me with the Grigri.\n    Figuring he had belaying down, I decided to work on another sport route I had\ntried once before, but wasn\u2019t able to do clean: I\u2019m Your Hate (5.11a). I started up the\nroute on lead and asked my father to take several times as I proceeded toward the\ncrux. I started into the crux section, which involves coming out of a dihedral and\naround an ar\u00eate, and then fell. I was only a few feet above a bolt, but I dropped approx-\nimately 35 feet to the ground.\n    I landed on both feet with the rope taut, implying the Grigri had caught my weight\njust as or before I hit the ground. We believe my father mistakenly held open the\nrelease mechanism on the Grigri with one hand as he attempted to arrest my fall.\nThe Grigri eventually engaged, likely when my father experienced a minor rope burn\non his hand and thus released his grip.\n    Using a pair of crutches kept at the park for community use, I was able to self-\nrescue. I later learned I had fractured my right calcaneus (heel bone) in the incident,\nwhich required surgical repair.\n\nANALYSIS\nI was so excited to go climbing and, lacking an experienced partner, I decided to\nrecruit an inexperienced belayer. I assumed the Grigri would prevent a leader fall no\nmatter what. However, like all belay devices, the Grigri requires proper training and\nexperience to use effectively. I should have put more focus on belay training and prac-\ntice, and stuck with climbs well within my onsight capabilities. (Source: Tom Bussell,\nage 36.)

Just reaching the base requires an hour-plus scramble up \u201cthe nastiest\ntalus and bushwhacking you can imagine,\u201d Grundstrom said. One reason they had\nsought a remote area was to avoid COVID exposure.\n    Once in the area, the pair assessed two potential climbs. At the base of one of\nthese, Meade tied in and started leading up a hand and fist crack. When Meade was\nabout 50 feet up, he pulled off a quartzite flake about 3 feet by 1.5 feet by 1 foot. As\nhe was falling, the flake cut the rope. He landed on the belay ledge and then tumbled\n25 more feet, bouncing over rocks and coming to rest at the bottom of the approach\ncouloir on a patch of snow.\n    Grundstrom immediately climbed down to his friend and completed a full assess-\nment, and within a couple of minutes called the police to initiate a rescue. Meade,\nwho was wearing a helmet, had several apparent injuries: an open fracture of his\nright elbow, to which Grundstrom later applied a tourniquet to control the bleeding;\na chest injury that led Grundstrom to believe Meade had a collapsed lung; a possible\nright orbital fracture around the eye; deformation of his lower lumbar spine, with\nno sensation or motor movement in his legs; and a pelvic fracture. He was conscious\nbut disoriented, and Grundstrom believed he might have a traumatic brain injury.\n    Grundstrom built a platform of backpacks to allow Meade to lie on top of the\nsnow, piled layers on him for warmth, and got him into a better position for breath-\ning. Rescuers from various agencies arrived at the scene approximately 1.5 to 2 hours\nafter Grundstrom called 911, and they prepared for a difficult helicopter hoist to\nextract the patient. As he was being transported off the mountain, about 5:35 p.m.,\nMeade succumbed to his injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe subject was an experienced climber who suffered a tragic accident. According\nto Grundstrom, this was Meade\u2019s first attempt at establishing a new route, and the\ntwo had agreed on a strict ground-up ethic. As a result, they chose not to rappel the\nline and remove loose rocks before climbing. (Sources: Tyler Grundstrom, Rock and\nIce, Salt Lake County Search and Rescue.)",

The very experienced\nclimber (male, 59) had been leading the first pitch of Crescent Crack (5.7 trad) when\nhe took a lead fall and a cam placement failed to hold. The climber dropped about 25\nfeet and flipped upside down with the rope caught behind his leg. He landed head-\nfirst on a ledge (he credits his helmet with saving his life). The belayer, his 20-year-old\nson, lowered the injured climber to a ledge, where he shakily slung a tree for another\nanchor (nearly dropping the rope in the process), and then was lowered to the ground.\n    The climber later wrote: \u201cI had already placed much of the gear on my rack in\nthe crack below me and lacked the size I needed to protect the next move. I reached\ndown, grabbed my last cam, and bumped it up higher\u2014keenly aware that the next\npiece below that one was now more than 10 feet down. I reset the cam a few times.\nIt wasn\u2019t the ideal size for the crack, but I believed I finally set it securely. [This was]\npossibly the first time in 30 years of climbing that a piece of gear I\u2019d placed didn\u2019t\nhold when I fell on it.\u201d\n    The leader was evacuated to the hospital, where scans revealed fractured C1\nand T3 vertebrae and a massive contusion on one thigh. Fortunately, he recovered\ncompletely from the serious spinal injuries.\n    The day after the Crescent Crack incident, SLCOSAR was called for another\ninjured climber in Little Cottonwood. A climber was leading Bongeater (5.10d trad)\nwhen he fell at the crux near the top of the route. His climbing partner said he fell\nabout six to ten feet to the last cam placement below him, and that cam pulled out.\nThe next two cams below that also pulled out. The fourth piece of gear held, but the\nclimber hit a ramp. Two broken ankles were suspected. The climber also had the\nrope briefly wrapped around his neck in the fall, causing ligature marks. The belayer\nlowered the climber and called for help. Unified Fire and SLCOSAR brought the\npatient to the trailhead, from which he was transported to a local hospital.

        "Incident_Type": "HIT BY FALLING ICE NEAR BASE OF CLIMB",
        "Details_Factors": "\nWasatch Range, Provo Canyon\nAround 10:30 a.m. on January 12, a group of three climbers arrived at the base of the\nStairway to Heaven (WI5) in Provo Canyon. The first pitch of this long climb is about\n190 feet long, with a ledge system that bisects the pitch a bit less than halfway up.\nThis ledge can be accessed without lead climbing by hiking uphill to climber\u2019s right\nand then traversing the ledge system. A couple of bolted anchors adorn this ledge, as\nwell as the opportunity to build anchors with ice screws. The ice below is called the\nApron (WI3) and is a popular top-roping venue. On a busy weekend, the Apron may\naccommodate up to a dozen ropes on lines from 30 feet to about 80 feet.\n     The Apron is located atop a rocky and snowy gully that gains approximately 300\nfeet at an average angle of 35\u201340 degrees. Particularly large or severe icefall or rock-\nfall occasionally enters the upper reaches of this gully, but avalanches are rare due to\nthe low elevation and limited snow accumulation. The Apron itself is also subject to\nicefall, typically from the climbing parties that accumulate there or from the upper\npitches of Stairway to Heaven.\n     On this day, Persons 1 and 3 waited below the Apron while Person 2 hiked up to\nthe ledge and traversed across to set up a top-rope. Persons 1 and 3 were located\naway from the base of the ice, so they would be unlikely to be hit by climber-gener-\nated icefall from parties on the Apron. Person 2 had just finished rigging a top-rope\nwhen a large chunk of ice (witnesses estimate approximately 12 inches in diameter)\nfell from above Person 2. The ice fell unimpeded for more than 150 feet and struck\nPerson 1 on the top of the head.\n     Person 1 was wearing a helmet but was immediately rendered unresponsive\nfrom the impact and fell over backward. Rigid and still unconscious, the individual\n                                                    began to slide head-first on their back down\n                                                   the approach gully, narrowly missing vege-\n                                                   tation and larger rocks. Person 3 and I (who\n                                                   was teaching nearby) gave chase as Person 1\n                                                   slid down the gully. Person 3 nearly reached\n                                                   Person 1 and then leapt face-first downhill in\n                                                   an effort to stop Person 1, in a manner that can\n                                                   only be described as heroic. Person 3 wrapped\n                                                   their arms around Person 1\u2019s legs and both slid\n                                                   downhill together for a few more feet.

The\nApron area (circled) is at the base of the five-\npitch climb. John Ross                    ANALYSIS\n                                          Falling ice is quite common at the Apron, as\nthere are often parties with beginners who may not be skilled at avoiding displace-\nment of ice while climbing. However, this icefall is relatively predictable and benign,\nmitigated by appropriate positioning of the belayer and other party members.\n    Natural icefall and occasional rockfall are less predictable. The fifth pitch of Stair-\nway to Heaven, about 350 feet above the Apron, is a pillar that begins as a hanging\ndagger. If the temperature warms above freezing, the lower-angle ice flows of the\nfirst three pitches of Stairway to Heaven (including the Apron) may remain climb-\nable, but the fifth pitch may suddenly fall off, showering the whole area with large\nchunks of ice. Consequently, before choosing to climb here, the wary climber checks\nconditions (there is a weather station at the trailhead), the forecast for the elevation\nof the upper climb, and the visual appearance of the fifth-pitch pillar to determine\nif there\u2019s a likelihood the fifth pitch might collapse.\n    On the day of this accident, the temperature at the trailhead did not rise above\nfreezing, with moderate wind and some snowfall at the Apron in the early to\nmidmorning.\n    It is not unusual for parties to top-rope on the Apron when there are climbers\nabove on the higher pitches of Stairway of Heaven. Nonetheless, this increases the\noverhead hazard, as icefall may be generated from climbers well above the Apron.\n(Parties rappelling may also dislodge rocks or ice blocks, particularly when pulling\n ropes; multi-pitch parties should consider walking off to climber\u2019s right from the\nbase of pitch two.) In this case, it appears the icefall may have come from a party on\nthe upper part of pitch two on Stairway or the lower part of pitch three. Stairway to\nHeaven is characterized by expansive ledges separating relatively vertical pitches\nof ice. Often, the ledges are snow-covered and are of sufficient size that icefall will\nstop at the ledge below. However, in early season or lean snow years, there may be\ninsufficient snow on the ledges for this to be reliable.\n    Given Person 1\u2019s conservative positioning in a relatively protected area, away\nfrom the base of the route, it is difficult to ascribe the icefall impact to much other\nthan inherent risk and bad luck. From an outside perspective, their positioning\nseemed appropriate. It\u2019s likely this accident only could have been prevented if parties\nelected not to climb the Apron with others above or if multi-pitch parties elected\nnot to begin the upper pitches with parties already established on the Apron below.\n(Source: Derek DeBruin.)",

I had\ntaught her how to lead belay and taken some short practice falls with her a few weeks\nearlier. I (female, 28) had not been climbing very much in the months leading up to\nthe accident, and although I previously sport climbed regularly, I had been climbing\nprimarily trad and wasn\u2019t in the habit of bringing a stick clip.\n    I first led a bolted 5.9+ that I had done the year before. It felt hard but within my\nability, and I did it with no takes or falls. The light was fading faster than I would have\nhoped, but I decided to try the route next door, Tax Free $ (5.10c), also a sport climb.\nI felt this route would be within my ability, though a challenge.\n    The base of the climb was uneven and sloping away from the wall. There was\na large, fallen tree at the base with roots that jut up toward the climb. My belayer\noffered to spot me, but I declined because it seemed like an awkward place and\nperhaps dangerous for her. The start felt insecure, and I fell off twice, about five feet\noff the ground, before clipping the first bolt.\n    I decided to push myself and give it one more try. I slipped and again fell approxi-\nmately five feet, this time landing awkwardly on my left ankle before somersaulting\nbackward down the slope. The rope came tight around the fallen tree and arrested\nmy fall. Immediately I knew that my left ankle was hurt. Otherwise, I had only a few\nscrapes. The helmet I was wearing likely prevented a minor concussion from the\nrocky slope. After visiting the hospital, I learned I had a slight calcaneus fracture and\nhad shattered the horn of my talus bone.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe contributing factors to this accident were lack of fitness, fatigue, and inadequate\nequipment. A wet winter, social distancing, and three jobs prevented me from climb-\ning in the months leading up to the accident, and I overestimated my fitness. When\nI started to lead this pitch, it was late in the day and I was tired. If I had brought and\nused a stick clip, I would have been protected before the first bolt.

        "Incident_Type": "STRANDED",
        "Details_Factors": "Incorrect Anchor, Stuck Rappel Ropes\nCastle Valley, Castleton Tower, West Face\nJust after sunset on December 4, two male climbers (ages 32 and 36) called 911 to\nreport they were stranded halfway down 400-foot Castleton Tower because their\nrappel ropes had become stuck. Starting near sunrise, the pair had climbed the Kor-\nIngalls Route (5.9) on the tower\u2019s south side. They topped out later than expected,\nwith about an hour and a half of daylight left.\n    Armed with guidebook photos and online beta, they planned to descend via the\nstandard North Face rappels. The two saw a beefy new anchor on top of the north-\nwest corner of the tower and decided this must be the first rappel anchor. Tying two\n70-meter ropes together, the first rappeler descended about 200 feet and spotted\na bolted anchor 25 feet to his right, but no other suitable anchor before the ends of\nthe ropes. No longer in voice contact with his partner, he ascended a short distance\nand moved right to reach the bolted anchor. It appeared that one more double-rope\nrappel would get them to the ground. Once both climbers reached the mid-face\nanchor, they attempted to pull the ropes. Despite applying full body weight to the\npull line, they could not get the ropes to budge.\n    Contemplating ascending the stuck rope, the climbers realized the other strand\nhad swung out of reach across a blank face. The climbers agreed that recovering\nthe other strand was not safe or practical, nor was climbing the unknown chimney\nabove them in the dark. The climbers were aware the temperature was expected to\ndrop to 15\u00b0F overnight, so they made the call for a rescue. They were prepared with\na headlamp, warm jackets, handwarmers, and an emergency bivy sack.\n    A team of three rescuers from Grand County Search and Rescue was transported\nto the summit via helicopter. One rescuer rappelled to the subjects around 9 p.m.\nand assisted them in rappelling to the base of the tower.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe rescuers discovered the climbers had mistakenly rappelled from an anchor\nused to rig a 500-meter highline (slackline) to the neighboring Rectory formation.\nInstead of rappelling the North Face, as planned, the climbers had ended up on the\nless-traveled West Face route (5.11). Because the highline anchors were not intended\nfor rappelling, friction made it impossible for the climbers to pull their ropes.\n    The climbing party identified a number of decisions that could have prevented this\nmisadventure. Had they abandoned the climb and rappelled the Kor-Ingalls Route\nearlier, they probably would have been down before sunset. Even after finishing the\nroute, heading back down the Kor-Ingalls would have had the advantage of familiarity\nwith the anchor stations, rather than rappelling into unknown territory. Lastly, while\nthe highline anchor is quite visible atop the tower, its configuration, set back from\nthe cliff edge with very short chain links, indicates it is not appropriate for a rappel.\nThe climbers may have felt rushed with the setting sun and dropping temperature,\nbut if they had looked more thoroughly, they likely would have found the North Face\n rappel station, about 30 feet away on top of the\ntower. This anchor\u2019s bolts have three or four feet\nof chain that extend over the edge and attach to\nlarge rappel rings, making for an easy pull.\n    After word got out about these stranded\nclimbers, a local guide removed the chain links\nfrom the highline anchor to discourage future\nincidents. (The links can easily be reinstalled\nto rig the highline.) There is a plan to attach\nplaques identifying the bolts as a highline anchor.\n(Sources: The climbers, Grand County SAR, and\nthe Editors.)\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: It is common for minor mishaps\nto cascade into a call for rescue. Had the climb-\ners noticed they did not seem to be rappelling\nin the correct place, they might have been more\ncautious about maintaining control of both ends of\nthe rappel ropes. A test pull after the first climber\ndescended also could have revealed the problem,\nallowing the upper climber to extend the anchor\nwith slings or the lower climber to ascend the Bolts installed to anchor a highline\n                                                       atop the northwest corner of Castleton\nropes and return to the top.

The correct rappel station\nat an anchor above, climbers can decide whether is about 30 feet to the right.\nto ascend the rope, lead climb up to the anchor, cut\nthe rope and descend with the remaining rope, or call for help. The last option may have\nbeen the only one left for these climbers to get off the tower safely.\n    As highlines, BASE jumps, and space nets grow in popularity, the number of\nnonclimbing bolted anchors at cliffs is on the rise, and rescues like this one are becom-\ning more prevalent. In fact, this is the second stranding resulting from an attempted\nrappel off this same highline anchor in five years. Study the published descriptions\nof anchor locations, and be aware that guidebooks and online references may not list\nnonclimbing anchors. If an anchor does not appear to be rigged properly for rappel-\nling\u2014especially on a very popular formation like Castleton Tower\u2014look around and\nconsider the options before committing to the rappel.",

Bone Mountain is an obscure cliff that takes about an hour and a half to reach\nin summer and about two hours of skinning in the winter. I was very familiar with the\narea, having developed many of the routes. Two young friends joined me on February\n17 to explore for winter lines.\n    At one of the furthest reaches of the cliff, we saw three distinct ice lines. The\nlargest was a free-standing column around 25 feet tall, and the second was easier.\nAfter doing both of these climbs, we looked at a line that began with a free-hang-\ning curtain of ice and talked about how to mitigate the risks. We knew we had a\nparty of three, cell phone reception, and a med kit, and I placed one ice screw uphill\nfrom the ice to prevent sliding down the hill if I needed to jump off while leading.\nThe bottom of the ice was roughly two feet from the ground.\n    The curtain required very slow movement and precision to climb. I ascended the\ncurtain to the point at which it met the rock about 15 feet up, and then, while reposi-\ntioning one of my tools, the curtain gave way with me on it. I hit the ground and the\ncurtain landed on me, breaking an ankle and lacerating my upper lip. It is unclear if\nmy ankle broke on impact with the ground or from ice landing on it. The lip injury was\ncaused by falling ice.\n    My partners assessed my injuries and found nothing other than the fractured ankle\nand lip. I never lost consciousness. We took off my ice boot and put on a ski boot before\nswelling could occur, mitigated the bleeding from my face, and then proceeded to ski\nfor three-plus hours back to the car. Before leaving, we called a number of friends to\n give them updates on our situation and then checked in every hour or so on the way\ndown. I was treated for a low tibia/fibula fracture, and the lip required 12 stitches.\n\nANALYSIS\nSimply put, I made a risky call and landed on the wrong side of that call. I knew what\nI was attempting to climb was dangerous, and ultimately I was either not skilled\nenough to handle the terrain or I just got unlucky on that day. It\u2019s worth noting that\nthe first climb of the day was likely much more dangerous, and a successful lead of\nthat free-standing column may have impacted my decision-making later in the day.\nThis is something I\u2019ve been reflecting on ever since.\n    At a more micro level, I was one move away from solid ice when I reached for the\nice with my left tool. I felt stretched out and came back down to reposition my right\ntool. One could argue I should have just completed the initial reach up to good ice.\nThe other wrong call was believing I was above the break line on the curtain\u2014I thought\nI had reached the point where the ice had bonded to the rock when I was reposition-\ning the tool. In hindsight, this was obviously not true. (Source: Anonymous climber.)",

        "Details_Factors": "LEADER FALL AND HEAD IMPACT\nUpper West Bolton\nAt approximately 1 p.m. on May 28, a 20-year-old male was leading the sport climb\nPeachy Canoodle (5.9) at Upper West Bolton. My partner, Ben Mirkin, and I were\nclimbing out of sight, but within earshot. The climber fell after clipping the third or\nfourth bolt. We heard a crashing sound followed by the female belayer shouting to\nher partner, with no response. She then yelled for help. We lowered off, gathered\nour first-aid supplies, and went to the scene.\n    The climber was suspended in the air about 15 feet above the ground and appeared\nto have taken a 10- to 15-foot fall, possibly after traversing off route. He was conscious,\nand I communicated with the victim regarding the importance of maintaining spinal\nalignment. I held the belayer\u2019s brake strand as backup, and then she asked us to lower\nthe patient, using the Grigri still clipped to her harness.\n    Once he was on the ground, Ben and I began to assess the patient. The primary\npresenting wound was an approximately two-inch laceration of the scalp, likely\ncaused by the helmet\u2019s headband. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d lost consciousness. We\nassessed his level of orientation, and he correctly identified his name, the date,\nand the place. We continued with our assessment, with a focus on spinal injury and\ncirculation, sensation, and movement (CSM). A few minutes later, we assessed his\norientation again and he could only identify his name. Concerned about intercranial\npressure (ICP), we called 911.\n    Though the patient had potentially lost consciousness during his accident, he\nreported no spinal pain upon palpation and his CSM was good. We felt that, given\nthe patient\u2019s ability to move and the potential ICP issues, it was important to begin\nevacuation. We tested his orientation again, and he could identify his name and the\nplace, but had trouble with the date. As we exited, we were intercepted by local\nrescue squads. They took over the evacuation, walking the patient to the trailhead\nand escorting him onto an ambulance.\n\n ANALYSIS\nAlthough I cannot confirm this, it appears the climber flipped over during the fall.\nIt is very important to monitor the placement of the rope relative to the legs when\nleading. Although it appears the headband of the helmet caused the climber\u2019s lacera-\ntion, I believe the helmet likely prevented more substantial head trauma. Some other\nobservations:\n\u2022   Both the climber and the belayer reported they were WFR-certified, and I believe\n    this helped us to more effectively deal with the patient, as he had a good under-\n    standing of the need to maintain spinal alignment.\n\u2022   Always bring a first-aid kit, no matter how \u201clocal\u201d and \u201ccasual\u201d your day is supposed\n    to be. Check and refresh your first-aid kit periodically. My gloves were old and\n    broke too easily, and my iodine swabs were a bit dry.\n\u2022   Get some basic training in vertical rescue. In this scenario, because he was conscious\n    and cooperative, it was relatively easy to get the climber back to the ground. This is\n    not always the case. It may be necessary to render first aid on the cliff and assist the\n    victim down. Basic vertical rescue training needs to become the climbing equiva-\n    lent of AIARE Level 1 in the backcountry skiing world\u2014demand that your partners\n    have it.

Shuksan after summiting\nvia the Sulphide Glacier route. The party was rappelling the standard descent on\nShuksan\u2019s summit pyramid. They reached a flat ledge and found an existing anchor\nconsisting of a single loop of red webbing around a rock horn. After pulling the rope\nfrom the previous rappel, one of the climbers, a 28-year-old female, began to rig the\nsecond-to-last rappel of their descent. She threaded the rope through the anchor,\nrigged her rappel device, and began to weight the anchor. The rock horn then failed,\nand the climber fell about 100 feet.

        "Details_Factors": "\nMorpheus Boulders\nOn March 21, with COVID-19 shutdowns and social-distancing guidelines in place,\nmy housemate, Will, and I decided to avoid crowded Mt. Saint Helens and instead go\nsearch for unclimbed boulders near the established Morpheus area, south of Highway\n2 and Skyhomish. I had been climbing outside for about five years at the time of the\naccident, including multiple climbs in remote areas.\n     It was a mostly sunny day, with the temperature starting out a bit above freezing\nand rising steadily. Around midday, we crossed the West Fork Miller River to the north\nside and decided to head away from the river and up a washout in search of poten-\ntially unclimbed rock. There was generally less snow on this south-facing aspect, with\nonly a few patches along our route. After a lot of exploring and a bit of bouldering,\nthe sun began to set, so we decided to pack up and head down the way we\u2019d come.\n     Will was out in front and I was lagging a safe distance behind, which was fortunate,\ngiven what happened next. For context, I weigh more than Will and was also carry-\ning our pads, so I probably had 30 pounds on him. As I got to the steep section in the\nwashout, I turned around to downclimb, placing my hands on a block the size of my\ntorso and stepping down to a smaller block. The foothold broke free when I weighted\nit, and then the larger block shifted and broke free. I instinctively jumped back, pushing\nmyself to the right of the fall line of the massive block as it careened down the wash.\nHowever, it crushed my left hand against the adjacent rock slab as it crashed past.\n     A moment later, I noticed my pinkie finger\ndangling, with the middle phalanx displaced and\nthe fingernail hanging by a thread, and the white of\nthe bones in my ring finger showing. Then every-\nthing was swallowed in a red gush of blood.

        "Details_Factors": "Cam Pulled Out\nCooper\u2019s Rock State Forest, Roof Rocks\nOn October 4, I (Mike Paugh, 38) and\nSarah Smith were searching for areas at\nCooper\u2019s Rock to bring clients with my\nnew guide service, Ascension Climbing\nGuides. We were also climbing routes in\nthe area. At about 2 p.m., I racked up to\nattempt Upchouca (5.12a/b), which begins\nwith an unprotected V5 start. I knew the\nroute was in my wheelhouse of climbing\nfitness but also at the peak of my climb-\ning limits. I felt confident about the send.\nI rehearsed the opening moves 10 to 12\ntimes, trying to find my sequence to the\nhero jug about 15 feet up.\n    I set off one last time, committing to\nthe boulder problem and fully aware there\nwas a point of no return where I could not\njump off without getting injured. I felt\ngassed and pumped immediately after\nmaking it through the crux, probably from\nthe numerous attempts to figure out my\nsequence. Unfortunately, the placement\nI had spotted from the ground for my\nfirst piece of protection turned out to be\ncomplete garbage.                                Mike Paugh had set up a video camera to record\n    Feeling pumped and realizing that I what he hoped would be an onsight of a 5.12\n                                                 route at Cooper\u2019s Rock. The site of the cam that\nwas in trouble, I continued upward and pulled out is marked. Video capture courtesy\nfound an excellent horizontal seam. I of Mike Paugh\nplaced a yellow Metolius TCU up to the\ntrigger, with all three lobes fully engaged, and clipped it using an alpine draw. Breath-\ning a sigh of relief, I asked my belayer, Sarah, to take me. The cam held and I proceeded\nto shake out my arms. The climbing above looked to ease up significantly, and I iden-\ntified a couple of solid gear placements.\n    As soon as I shifted my body weight to the left and prepared to continue up the\nroute, the TCU blew from the rock with the sound of a 12-gauge shotgun. When it\npopped, a piece of rock hit me in the face as I began to fall. Everything sped up, and\nthe next thing I remember is hitting the ground and screaming in pain. I suffered an\nopen fracture of my left tibia and fibula. Thankfully, there was a party of four climb-\ners nearby who responded to Sarah\u2019s call for help until EMS arrived.\n ANALYSIS\nI had three surgeries to repair the damage and later remove the external fixation\ndevice attached to my leg. I\u2019ve been doing great with my recovery, and I\u2019ve started\nclimbing again.\n    Given the hard, bouldery crux in the first 15 to 18 feet of this route and the rocky\nlanding below it, I should have placed bouldering pads at the base of the climb, treat-\ning it like a highball boulder problem. Protecting the landing zone should have been\npriority number one, especially for a ground-up, on-sight attempt. Once I reached\nthe jug hold past the crux, I was in a no-return, no-fall zone, especially without any\npad protection.\n    I\u2019ve also realized I should have considered setting up a top-rope to rehearse\nthe route, due to its PG-13 rating and not being able to assess gear placements\nadequately from the ground. Had I done so, I could have safely assessed the rock\nquality (which was a little chossy in the crack) and the protection before leading. I\nalso could have backed up that single TCU with another placement before asking\nSarah to take my weight.\n    I am extremely grateful to the group of young climbers who kept me calm and\ncalled 911 and to everyone who helped get me out of there and care for my injuries.\n(Source: Mike Paugh.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Broken Hold\nNew River Gorge, Endless Wall, Party Buttress\nIt was November 21, and our day started by warming up on Riding the Crest of the\nWave (5.9 trad) at Idol Point. We then walked to Party Buttress to attempt Harbinger\nScarab (5.12c), a 100-foot, mostly bolted route that requires a couple of traditional\npieces down low. Markus Kauffman (23) climbed through the roof crux, which is four\nor five bolts up, and was making his way up the steep headwall above. He was past the\nseventh bolt and about 30 feet past the roof when the accident occurred.\n    Markus had rested at the seventh bolt so he could work out the sequence\nabove. He then made a couple more moves and began a final dynamic move off his\nright hand. At that point, I heard him scream, \u201cRock!\u201d and saw Markus falling along\nwith a softball-size piece of rock\u2014the right handhold had broken. The rock did not\nstrike him as he fell. There was an appropriate amount of slack in the system, and I\ngave him a dynamic catch as I have hundreds of other times. But what should have\nbeen a benign fall, if his body remained upright, turned into one that involved a rescue\nand me writing an accident report.\n    Pulling hard with his right hand and ripping off the hold must have thrown Markus\noff-balance and created enough momentum to cause him to invert and twist, so the\nright side of his head struck the wall. I called up to him to see if he was okay. He did not\nrespond, and his body was limp. I lowered him to the ground and began to assess the\nsituation. I called for help, did a primary trauma assessment, and made sure Markus\ndid not move his neck. Another climber called 911 at 11:15 a.m.\n    Markus regained consciousness within one minute of being lowered to the ground\nand knew his name and where he was after a few minutes. A group of climbers helped\nme care for him while we waited for help. The Fayette County High Angle Rescue\n Team arrived at 1:45 p.m. via fixed lines above the nearby climb, Smooth Operator\n(5.9). Markus was in a helicopter around 2:40 p.m. and flown to a nearby hospital. He\nsuffered multiple fractures on the right side of his face, multiple lacerations on his\nface and forehead, and was diagnosed with a small subdural hematoma in his frontal\nlobe at the hospital. He was discharged after three days in the hospital.\n\nANALYSIS\nMarkus was not wearing a helmet. Wearing one, even while sport climbing, can\ndecrease the risk of injury during rockfall and in the event of bad lead fall, or at least\nlessen the severity of the injury. Knocking on holds and not using ones that sound\nhollow is a good habit. Lastly, carry a good first-aid kit and exchange the phone\nnumbers of emergency contacts with climbing partners.

He hit a slab toward the bottom\n                                                  loop for a top-rope anchor. The loop appar-\nof the climb and came to rest within 15 feet of ently rubbed against a sharp edge and cut.\nthe base. In total he fell approximately 50 feet.\n    The climber sustained two collapsed lungs, six broken ribs, a broken scapula, a\nbroken leg, a puncture in his right shin, a burn across his neck, a punctured blad-\nder, and abrasions across his body. An EMT and WFA were on the scene immediately\nand placed the climber into recovery position on his left side after noting the most\nextensive damage was right-sided. Within 10 minutes, park staff were organizing the\nrescue. It took approximately an hour to litter and move the patient to a safe zone\nfor a helicopter. He was then airlifted out of the park to receive emergency care. The\npatient was expected to make a full recovery.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe top-rope anchor was set up in two parts. First, a large boulder on top of Gill\u2019s\nButtress was slung as protection. To extend the anchor closer to the edge, a 60m\n Black Diamond nylon runner (about two years old and used only three times as\nintended) was clipped to the protection with a figure-8 knot. This sling was tied into\na masterpoint with a second figure-8 knot. Two locking carabiners were attached to\nthe masterpoint, and the rope was threaded through these carabiners. The accident\noccurred due to a failure of the nylon runner in the masterpoint loop, causing the\nrope, carabiners, and Climber 1 to fall to the ground, while the rest of the anchor\nremained on top.\n     The protection used, a large boulder, was an excellent choice for the area.\nHowever, the extension could have been improved by using thick, abrasion-resis-\ntant static rope. Otherwise, cordelette (long enough to be doubled) or two separate\nslings should have been used. Two loops in the masterpoint might have prevented\nthis accident.\n     Pictures of the sling indicate a relatively clean, linear cut. The quartzite at Devil\u2019s\nLake is known for sharp edges, and climbers must be diligent in inspecting the rock\nat edges, corners, and breaks, including areas the anchor materials could \u201cwalk\u201d to.\nIt is unknown if the masterpoint had significant travel. Most likely, the direction of\npull during Climber 1\u2019s fall partially cut the sling, and a moment after he weighted\nthe rope, the nylon separated at the weakness.

They were using ice axes and crampons and wear-\ning helmets. During the late afternoon and early evening, several thunderstorms\npassed over the Tetons. As the party dealt with these storms, they realized they\nwere descending a slope they had not traveled during their ascent earlier in the\nday. At approximately 8 p.m., one of the climbers (age 32) slipped and fell near the\ntop of the Cave Couloir, which rises above Garnet Meadows. [Another person who\nobserved these climbers believes the man attempted to glissade and lost control.] He\nslid approximately 200 feet on snow, stopping after impacting a large boulder. He\nsustained serious injuries to the left side of his body, including a suspected broken\nfemur or femoral head.\n    The partner descended to the Meadows, where he contacted a person with a\ncell phone. At approximately 9:20 p.m., the call was forwarded to the on-duty SAR\ncoordinator, and the caller relayed the location of the incident and provided GPS\ncoordinates. She also mentioned that the partner had grabbed a sleeping bag and\nwas climbing back up to the injured climber.\n    Climbing rangers Ronczkowski and Hunsaker departed the Lupine Meadows\n trailhead at 10:30 p.m. They reached the injured climber at 12:55 a.m., assessed and\nstabilized his injuries, and made him as comfortable as possible for the night.

Josh explained that his partner, Tyler,\nage 34, had disappeared into a crevasse about 20 minutes prior to their arrival. Tyler\nhad fallen roughly 25 feet into the crevasse, which was estimated to be 45 feet deep.\nHe was stuck sideways in a horizontal position in a constriction in the crevasse. Josh\nhad prepared the lip of the crevasse and lowered a rope to Tyler, but Tyler was unable\nto secure himself nor manage prusiks to ascend out of the crevasse.\n    Tyler had been unroped but was wearing a helmet and a harness. He was in shorts,\na cotton shirt, and light insulating jacket. He was not wearing crampons and had\nlimited mobility of his arms and hands. His backpack was partially attached to him.\nThe crevasse hole at the surface was roughly five feet by four feet.\n    An SOS text message was attempted at roughly 10 p.m. via a Garmin inReach, but\nlimited view of the sky prevented its successful sending.\n    Two deadman snow anchors were constructed uphill of the crevasse in heavy,\nwet snow. A 3:1 Z-drop haul system was assembled, using prusiks and a Tibloc trac-\ntion device. A large bowline was lowered to Tyler in an attempt to raise him by his\narmpits, since access to his harness was prevented by his position in the crevasse.\n    With two people hauling on the Z-drop and the third tending the progress prusik,\nTyler was raised roughly 20 feet. The original lip, prepared by Tyler\u2019s partner, had\nmorphed into a ceiling in the remaining snow bridge, preventing Tyler from making a\nsmooth exit onto the surface. Feeling extreme pain from the pressure of the rope and\nworried he would fall, Tyler urgently asked to be lowered. He ended up back in his origi-\nnal position, 25 feet down and stuck in the constriction, with no access to his harness.\n    A new lip in the crevasse was prepared and Ryan, using a long loop on the unused\nlength of the 60-meter rope, rappelled into the crevasse to reach Tyler, who was now\nminimally vocal and responsive.

Unable to securely move him this way, the party\nresorted to incremental lifts, supporting his head.\n     At 11:45, Tyler was situated at the edge of the glacier on the first dirt and rock\navailable. A platform of rocks, ropes, and backpacks was created in an attempt to\n insulate him. He was completely unresponsive at this time, infrequently moaning and\nsnoring. He had foam at the mouth and intermittent spasms of his legs and arms,\nwhich demanded constant tending to keep him covered in his makeshift clothing.\n     A successful inReach message was sent and acknowledged by Grand Teton\nNational Park at 11:45 p.m., but continued poor reception prevented the climbers\nfrom replying. Rangers Shain and Evans began hiking to the Teton Glacier at approxi-\nmately 12:30 a.m. Tyler\u2019s partner snuggled up to him to provide body warmth, and\nthe climbers monitored his vitals. The two climbing rangers located the climbers a\nlittle after 4 a.m. With new and dry supplies, Tyler was layered and wrapped, and a\nplatform for a short-haul litter was created. A ranger actively warmed Tyler with his\nbody heat and hands. By 7 a.m., Tyler was verbal and aware of his surroundings. He\nhad memory of his fall and the incident.\n     Arrangements were made to fly Tyler directly to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical\nCenter. Soon, rangers arrived by helicopter and dropped off a litter and full-body\nvacuum mattress, as a precaution because of spinal injuries. A little after 8 a.m., Tyler\nwas short-hauled off the glacier to Lupine Meadows, where he was transferred to\nan air ambulance. The rest of the party followed in two subsequent flights to Lupine\nMeadows. Tyler was treated for hypothermia and discharged after a few days, with\nsome lingering nerve damage in his hands.\n\nANALYSIS\nThere is no record of any prior crevasse fall on the lower Teton Glacier in this publica-\ntion\u2019s archives. This crevasse was in a nearly flat section near the toe of the glacier.\nThe many climbers who cross this part of the glacier while hiking to or from Mt. Owen\nrarely if ever rope up. One reasonable precaution before crossing any snowfield or\nglacier is to cover all skin (long pants vs. shorts) as protection against abrasion in a\nfall; however, additional clothes were unlikely to prevent Tyler\u2019s hypothermia after\nbeing inside a wet crevasse for two hours.\n    The two climbers who came upon this scene after a long day in the mountains,\nalong with Tyler\u2019s partner, worked through the night to save him\u2014a highly commend-\nable effort.

        "Details_Factors": "\nWind River Range, Pingora Peak\nFour climbers summited Pingora Peak in the Cirque of the Towers on September 5\nand started down the south buttress. They chose to rappel a line to the left of the\nmain south buttress route, using two ropes tied together. Two of them had used this\ndescent two days earlier.\n    They team completed the first rappel and gathered at the next anchor, consisting\nof slings around a boulder. As one of the climbers pulled the ropes from their first\nrappel, a rock came down the face and smashed into the anchor, cutting both slings\naround the boulder. Janette Heung, 35, had been clipped into the anchor, and she\nfell when it was cut. One of the other climbers also began to fall, but was able to grab\na sling girth-hitched to the harness of one of his companions. The climbers, none\nof whom were now connected to any anchor, quickly secured themselves and each\nother to an older adjacent anchor. Heung fell about 400 feet to the ground.\n    One of the climbers used an inReach to contact search and rescue. The team\nbuilt a new anchor and descended to Heung\u2019s location. They attempted to revive her\nbut were unsuccessful. A helicopter with a crew from Tip Top Search and Rescue\narrived about one hour after the fall and continued resuscitation efforts, but Heung\nsuccumbed to her injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nJanette Heung was an expert alpine and ice climber, and her partners are highly\nexperienced as well. The climbers believe that pulling the rappel rope dislodged the\nrock that fell. The anchor materials at their stance consisted of a recently placed\ndouble-length Dyneema sling and an older, UV-damaged loop of tubular webbing,\nconnected by a quick-link.\n   This was a tragic and unusual accident, and it\u2019s not certain that anything specific\ncould have been done to prevent it. As general advice for such rappels, take care to\nposition the rappel ropes to avoid potentially loose horns, flakes, or rocks on ledges,\nand consider backing up fixed rappel anchors during transitions from one rappel to\nthe next. It costs little time to plug a cam into a crack and clip into it directly\u2014this is\nespecially important for larger groups and/or crowded stances.

I was climbing in a group of three ahead of five friends\ndoing the same route in two rope teams. At around 11 a.m., I was near the top of the\nWI3+ pitch when I made a poor placement with one tool. As I was removing my other\ntool for the next placement, the first tool popped and I fell.\n    I was climbing with 8.2mm half ropes and clipping every other screw with them.\nMy last screw was approximately six feet below my boots when I fell.

My partner was able to get me to the snow ledge below,\nand we called for help.\n    Various climbers in the area as well as members of Park County Search and Rescue,\nCody Regional Wilderness Medical Team, and Big Horn County Search and Rescue\nresponded. Rescuers reached the scene at about 2:30 p.m. I was put in a litter and\nlowered two pitches to the ground, then carried to a tracked snow vehicle, which\ntook me to an ambulance.

        "Details_Factors": "Climbing Unroped, Exposure\nBritish Columbia, Coast Mountains, Chimai Mountain\nSeven mountaineering club members had planned a climb of Chimai Mountain (2,306\nmeters), northwest of Squamish, in July. Although the mountain is glaciated, online\nresearch had suggested there was a route to the top that did not involve glacier\ntravel. As a result, they took no ropes but did carry ice axes, crampons, and helmets.\n    On July 18, they made an early start from a logging road at the bottom of the\nvalley. During the ascent, two members of the group fell behind while the remain-\ning climbers continued on to reach the summit by midafternoon. The final leg of the\nascent involved a short diagonal route along a narrow snow line between a small\nbergschrund feature and a large moat just below. While descending the same route,\none member of the group (male, mid-50s) slipped in the soft snow above the moat\nand, unable to stop, slid over the edge and free-fell about four meters before enter-\ning the moat, striking rock outcrops along the way. The individual landed on rock\napproximately five meters below the lip of the moat.\n    The party activated a satellite distress beacon while attempting to provide aid\nto the injured person, who was responsive. Without a rope, they were unable to\nextricate the stranded member, though they were able to get extra clothing to him.\n    Due to the remote location, it was well over an hour before Squamish Search and\nRescue was able to reach the site via helicopter. Rescuers found the subject standing in\nthe bottom of the moat but, due to language difficulties, were not able to communicate\nwith him. After building snow anchors, a rescuer rappelled into the moat and attached\na rescue harness to the patient, so he and the rescuer could be raised out of the moat.\nAt the hospital, the patient was found to have serious head trauma and a spinal injury.\n    All of the other party members were mildly hypothermic, as they had given all of\n their extra clothing to the patient. The entire team, including the two members who\nhad stopped well below the summit, was flown out by helicopter.\n\nANALYSIS\nWhen traveling on soft snow, especially on a western aspect in the afternoon, cram-\npon spikes may not penetrate sufficiently through the snow layer to provide secure\nfooting. Also, crampons may ball up with wet snow. Careful plunge-stepping and use\nof an ice axe are required to remain secure.\n     An awareness of hazards below might have helped the party pick a better descent\nroute. While avoiding crevasses, the climbing party exposed themselves to other\nhazards, and without a rope they did not have the ability to protect themselves or\nperform a companion rescue. It should be noted that moats can be deeper than\ncrevasses, and they also can hold numerous rock outcroppings\u2014as in this case\u2014so a\nfall can easily result in serious injury.\n     Mountaineers should be prepared to undertake a rescue because an organized\nrescue may be some time away, even in good weather. They also should take extra\nclothing and gear to deal with an emergency. In this case, the party members had\nonly a single extra layer each, which they gave to the injured party, leaving themselves\nexposed to the cold. This turned the entire party into rescue subjects. Members of this\ngroup also became separated, reducing the number of people available to provide assis-\ntance and prolonging the rescue. (Source: Bob Manson, Squamish Search and Rescue.)",

As two skiers watched from\n                                                     above, the first skier started down,\n                                                     and it was obvious the snow was vari-\n                                                     able.

Parks Canada           We lost sight of the falling skier as they\n                                                     went around a small corner. We heard a\nloud bang seconds later and then heard nothing.\n     We waited approximately 10 to 15 seconds and then started to descend, moving\nvery cautiously. We came across one pole, then another, and a ski, at which point we\nwere able to see the skier, roughly 300 vertical meters below us on the slope, and\nmake vocal contact.\n     The skier\u2019s face showed some blood from a split lip, and they expressed concerns\nabout knee and shoulder injuries. An initial assessment for head trauma was made,\nand the helmet was checked for signs of impact. Both were negative. The fallen skier\nwas wrapped with additional warm layers and stabilized in position. We then sent\nan SOS on our inReach device. We knew a helicopter would not be able to maneu-\nver into the space where we were located, as we were fairly close to the wall of the\ncouloir, so we decided to move the skier to the middle of the couloir after a platform\nwas cleared. There, we continued to treat the skier with hot liquid, energy gels, and\na couple of painkillers. The helicopter crew was able to fly into the area and remove\nthe skier via long-line rescue. From the SOS signal to the extraction of the skier, the\ntime was roughly one hour and 40 minutes.\n     With enough daylight remaining, the two others skied back to the car. The injured\nskier was later released from the hospital with a reset shoulder and a knee injury that\n was expected to heal with physical therapy. This was a lucky outcome, considering\nthe potential injuries from a fall in this location. (Source: Member of the ski party.)\n\nANALYSIS\nInherent in skiing a steep, big mountain couloir is the risk of falling and not being\nable to stop. There are several things people can do to mitigate this risk. First, wait\nfor optimal surface conditions (i.e., softer snow or consistent snow). Often it is\ntricky to balance avalanche risk with the risk of falling. Second, ensure that all party\nmembers are expert skiers. Further, ensure the equipment is appropriate and will\nfunction properly (appropriately adjusted ski bindings, boots and skis free of ice\nbuildup, helmets secured). At a certain level, all party members must be willing to\naccept that it will be very difficult or impossible to arrest a fall. Usually, when people\nfall in a steep couloir like this, they end up at the bottom on flatter terrain. Stopping\npartway down likely contributed to the injured skier\u2019s positive outcome.\n     From the rescuer\u2019s perspective, the party did a good job of moving the injured\nskier to a location that was accessible with a helicopter long line. They also did well\nto shovel a large, flat landing area for the rescuer to detach from the long line and\npackage the patient. One thing to consider when choosing a spot for a helicopter\npickup is any overhead hazard. In this case, it was a cool day with minimal winds,\nso nothing was moving in the couloir. However, when possible\u2014and when it allows\nenough clearance for a helicopter to fly overhead\u2014it is better to be situated where\nthere is more shelter from snow or rocks that may fall down the couloir.

        "Details_Factors": "Wall Impact\nAlberta, Banff National Park, Lake Louise\nOn July 22, three climbers were on The Search, a 5.10 sport route at the Back of the\nLake crag. This pitch starts off a large ledge about 20 meters above the ground. At\naround 3 p.m., the leader fell while climbing above the fourth bolt and impacted the\ncliff with one leg. It was a strange, twisting fall that resulted in an injury to the left\nknee (shattered patella). The leader was lowered back to the ledge by the belayer,\nand they called Banff Dispatch for help. The injured climber was in too much pain to\nbe lowered to the ground by the two partners.\n    The Banff Visitor Safety team responded with a helicopter from Canmore. The\nteam initially thought they might be able to heli-sling onto the ledge. However, after\na test run without rescuers on the line, it was decided the terrain above was too over-\nhanging for that technique. The rescuers landed nearby and walked and climbed to\naccess the ledge. After splinting the injury and administering some pain medication,\nthey lowered the climber to the ground in a stretcher.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Search is gently overhanging and has a cruxy start. It is common for people to fall\nat the first or second bolt, where they risk a ledge fall. In this accident, the climber fell\nat the fourth bolt and impacted the cliff in a sideways fashion, injuring one knee. The\nreason given for the fall was sweaty hands. It was a warm day for the area, about 25\u00b0C.\n     Falling safely while rock climbing is a learned skill, as is belaying sport climbs,\nwhere falls are to be expected. Sometimes a tight belay (a \u201chard catch\u201d) will cause\nthe climber to swing into the wall with greater force, but it is not certain this was a\ncontributing factor. While belaying a leader on a climb like The Search, the belayer\nneeds to weigh the risk of giving the climber a softer catch and longer fall (and poten-\ntially a ledge fall) versus a shorter fall and potentially harder catch. This situation\nis fairly common in sport climbing, and the leader and belayer should discuss the\nrisks and appropriate belay before each new climb.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Planning\nAlberta, Banff National Park, Castle Mountain\nA party of two climbers spent August 13 on Super Brewer, a long alpine rock climb\nthat links the Ultra Brewer and Brewer Buttress routes on Castle Mountain. Ultra\nBrewer (330m, III 5.9) climbs to the Goat Plateau, a large ledge system at mid-height\non the mountain, while Brewer Buttress (380m, II 5.6) continues to the top. A well-\nestablished yet fairly involved descent route follows a prominent gully with a few\nrappels to the Goat Plateau, and another series of rappels and downclimbing lead\nback to the base of the cliff.\n    Banff Dispatch received a call from an acquaintance of one of the climbers at\n9:14 p.m., shortly after sunset. The caller had just talked to the subjects on their cell\nphone, and they reported they were still one pitch from the top. They had asked their\nacquaintance to call Parks Canada and arrange for them to be picked up from the top.\nFurthermore, they only had five percent battery life left on their phone.\n    Visitor Safety explained to the caller that it was too late for a helicopter to fly and\nrequested the climbing party\u2019s phone number. The caller was asked not to contact\n the climbers again, so their remaining battery power could be used to communicate\nwith Parks Canada.\n    Texts were sent to the subjects starting at 9:25 p.m. It was determined they had\nheadlamps but did not know the usual climber\u2019s descent or the popular scrambling\nroute down the opposite side of the mountain, and were using a topo stored on their\nphone for route information. The party was asked to decide whether they would\nattempt to descend or stay put. At 10:30 p.m., the party messaged back: \u201cToo dark,\nwe will stay here. Battery at 1%.\u201d\n    At this point, Visitor Safety made the decision to pick up the party first thing in\nthe morning. This was not based on the party\u2019s request nor the expectation that they\nwould have a rough night. Rather, there was no way to communicate with them.\nFurther, even with good light and a route description in hand, many parties histori-\ncally have had difficulty with this descent.\n    At 6:15 a.m. the next day, Visitor Safety personnel left Banff by helicopter. At 6:25\na.m., the party was found under their tarp, taking shelter in the lee of a rock outcrop\ndirectly above the top of the route. They were both adequately dressed and reported\nbeing a bit hungry and cold during the flight down to the highway.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe main problem facing this party was not knowing how to get down. If you plan\nto attempt a long, challenging route on a mountain, consider doing an easier route\nto learn the descent first. In this case, there were two viable descent options, but\nboth would have been very difficult to figure out in the dark, and even more difficult\nwith no route description or map. The party\u2019s decision to stay put was a good one.\n    The reliance on smart phones for communication, navigation, and a source of\nroute information is becoming common. This tactic may work well on shorter, less-\ncommitting routes, but phones are less reliable on longer endeavors. As the device runs\nout of battery power, climbers are left with no communication resources at the most\ncritical part of their day. Several strategies can be employed to prevent this situation:\n\u2022   Print hard copies of route information and maps. Each party member should carry\n    this information so the ability to make decisions in an emergency is not compro-\n    mised. If all else fails, the paper can be used as a fire starter.\n\u2022   Carry alternate navigation tools, such as GPS or a compass.\n\u2022   Carry a backup communication device.\n\u2022   Preserve battery life. If battery strength starts to get low, shut the device off. If\n    your group is carrying two devices, keep the backup shut off. Alternatively, carry\n    a backup battery supply to keep devices functioning.\n\n    This party had plenty of daylight when they arrived at the Goat Plateau, where they\nhad easy access to the lower half of the descent route. The decision to continue on the\nupper route without being sure of the way down was a significant gamble. When the\nclimbing day is not going as planned, communicate this fact early to an outside party.\nCommunicate a clear set of intentions, and stick to that plan so outside resources do\nnot have to guess what you will do. Organize check-in times so you can turn off commu-\nnication devices to preserve battery life. Above all, do not wait until sunset to call for\nhelp. It is an unreasonable assumption to expect a rescue at night.\n     Finally, getting benighted does not need to be considered an emergency, as\nlong as a party is prepared with the appropriate equipment. This party was well\nequipped with waterproof outerwear, warm layers, and a tarp. They made a good\ndecision not to attempt an unfamiliar descent in the dark, but with a written route\ndescription in their pockets, they likely could have safely descended in the morn-\ning for a big breakfast in Banff.

The route is an alpine rock climb with a three-hour approach.\nIt starts with a few hundred meters of third- and fourth-class scrambling to reach\na bolted anchor. From this anchor, there is a short descent into a gully, where the\ntechnical rock climbing starts.\n    The first pitch is 5.9 and includes a corner that is often dirty or wet. The leader\nstarted up this first pitch and made an extra effort to place some pieces in the lower\npart of the pitch. The upper part consists of a wide crack that can be protected with\nnumber 4 cams. In an effort to keep packs light, the climbers had brought only a single\nnumber 4, intending to bump that cam up the wide section. The leader had climbed\nthe route several times before and felt comfortable with this tactic.\n    High on the pitch, the leader set the big cam and committed to the final moves\nup to the anchor.

Parks Canada                           lot of experience placing trad gear and\n described the number 4 cam that pulled as \u201c90 percent good.\u201d In hindsight, the leader\nthought the cam pulled out because the sides of the crack were coated with fine dirt\nand limestone dust. Meltwater from snow high up on the route funnels down the\ncorner on pitch one, and this pitch is always covered in varying degrees of dirt. The\nleader felt that dirt on the sides of the crack decreased the friction between the cam\nlobes and the rock.\n    This is a common problem on alpine routes and even more so in winter with ice\nand water ever present. Cams are highly suspect if the friction of the cam lobes on\nthe rock is inadequate. Passive protection that has a tighter fit\u2014such as nuts, hexes,\nor pitons hammered into cracks\u2014might inspire more confidence when the friction\nof the side walls is an issue.\n    On previous ascents of this route, the leader often did not place the smaller cam\nthat actually caught the fall. The leader made an effort to place more protection this\ntime and was very glad to have done so. That small cam had been deemed a much worse\nplacement than the large cam that pulled out\u2014but you never know what can happen.\n    From a rescuer perspective, there was concern regarding rockfall from the party\noverhead. As a general rule, if you are above an accident scene, stop moving while\na rescue is in process. If you are not moving, the chance of knocking rocks onto the\nscene below is greatly reduced.

Rundle from\nCanmore to Banff. They had attempted the traverse earlier in the summer and made\nit to a bivy site just beneath Peak 7. They aborted the attempt at that time because the\ntraverse was too snowy, making for slow travel. They monitored the peak and made\ntheir second attempt after a period of good weather that melted away the alpine\nsnow, leaving the ridge in dry condition.\n    The Mt. Rundle Traverse covers about 25 kilometers and passes over 11 separate\nsummits. The technical difficulty is about 5.5, but loose rock and the sheer length\nof the traverse compound the difficulties. The complete traverse usually requires at\nleast one very long day.\n    In the afternoon, the party reached Peak 10, which has a short chimney climb\nright below its summit. At this rock step, one of the party members (E.M.) wanted a\nbelay. A.S. offered to drag a rope up to the top, set up an anchor, and belay E.M. up.\nA.S. was about 20 meters up, comfortably climbing the chimney, when a foothold\nbroke and the climber fell to the ledge below, breaking one lower leg. A.S. was not on\nbelay at the time of the fall, so E.M. pulled in the slack and wrapped the rope around\nher hands. This makeshift belay and the rope running around a large, loose boulder\nblocked A.S. from tumbling further down the west side of Mt. Rundle.\n    Immediately after the fall, at 2:45 p.m., the party requested a rescue with their\ninReach device. Parks Canada rescue personnel were able to communicate with the\nclimbers on their cell phone briefly, but the phone battery was low, and cell commu-\nnication ended abruptly.

I\u2019d climbed it without incident\nthree times over the past 18 years. This time, as I neared the top of the first pitch (5.5),\nI saw two shiny new bolts above a small ledge. I assumed this was where the pitch\nended and set up the belay for the second pitch there. When my partner, Tibor, was\nabout four meters up on the second pitch (5.7), I suddenly remembered that when\nI\u2019d climbed this route before, we had ended the first pitch in an alcove higher up.\n    When Tibor was approximately 40 meters up, he stepped on a ledge that failed,\nresulting in significant rockfall. Several pieces the size of bread loaves bounded down\nthe face and directly onto my exposed belay stance. Fortunately, I was hit only by five\nsmaller rocks, which resulted in various flesh wounds. We rappelled off, patched a\nbleeding leg wound with a gauze pad and duct tape, and walked back to the car under\nour own steam. In retrospect, I was just plain lucky. Although I was wearing a helmet,\na direct head hit by one of the big rocks likely would have been fatal.\n\nANALYSIS\nWe got into trouble because we did not consider my belay stance\u2019s exposure to poten-\ntial rockfall. If we had relocated the belay for the second pitch to the well-protected\nalcove I had used before, I would not have been injured by the rockfall.\n    The new bolts that I mistakenly took to be the belay station for the second pitch\nmay have been placed for rappelling the route. The walk-off from this route is tedious,\nso rapping to descend has definite appeal. But this new station is exposed to rockfall\nfor anyone who rappels the route or chooses to belay from this spot.\n    Ice climbers are very careful about where they set up belays, because falling ice is\na given.

The sun had just gone down, and we had two moderate\n5.11 pitches to go before our next bivy. He made it about 80 feet into the pitch and\nthen, after manteling onto a large ledge, the refrigerator-size block of volcanic rock\ndislodged from under his feet. As he was falling, the rope was cut by the huge block\nand he fell all the way to the ground.\n    I was left alone on the wall with a shortened lead line and a limited number of\ndraws. A three-day storm was forecast to start the next afternoon. Below me was a\nsizable traverse that I wasn\u2019t confident I\u2019d be able to descend safely while keeping\nmy bivy kit. On top of that, we had rappelled in to start the climb, and I didn\u2019t know\nthe walk-out exit for the canyon; this exit route also passes very near several poppy\nfields run by the local cartel.\n    Instead, I started roped soloing up to our planned bivy. I primarily used a stick\nclip, but on occasion free climbing was necessary. I alerted a good friend, Sergio\n\u201cTiny\u201d Almada, about the situation via my inReach, and he started toward the wall\nwith another Mexican climber, Jos\u00e9 David \u201cBicho\u201d Martinez, planning to rappel in so\nI could jumar the last 1,200 feet to the top.

I recall rappel-\nling past the same ledge earlier with a large haul bag. It looked concerning, but after\ngiving it a thorough test, I deemed it solid. Nolan must have had the same thoughts\nduring his lead. It had been snowing for three days before we rappelled in, and this\naccident happened three days after the snow stopped. It is possible that a freeze-\nthaw cycle contributed to the rockfall, but there is no way of definitively knowing.\nSometimes a rock that many people have pulled on has a day that it is going to release.\nUnfortunately, it released on Nolan.\n    Don\u2019t underestimate Logical Progression because it\u2019s a \u201csport route.\u201d This wall\nis remote, large, and committing.

        "Incident_Type": "SIDECOUNTRY AVALANCHE",
        "Details_Factors": "Unaware of Forecast\nWashington, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Alpental Valley\nIn the afternoon of Saturday, April 10, 2021, a group of three skiers loaded Chair 2 at\nAlpental ski area to access terrain beyond the area boundary. They had been skiing\ninbounds in the Alpental back bowls for a large part of the day. Upon reaching Piss\nPass, the trio ascended on foot to the top of a small knob (5,440 feet) separating the\nAlpental resort and the Pineapple Pass area. While the team discussed the intended\nroute, they did not discuss that the line was in the backcountry, nor had anyone in the\ngroup checked the avalanche forecast for the area. Only some of the skiers carried\navalanche rescue gear, and they had varying degrees of formal avalanche instruction.\n    Skier 1 led the group off the knob and toward a run known as 261. The group\nwitnessed a lone snowboarder riding a line very close to their intended descent. Prior\nto entering the run, Skier 1 mentioned the possibility of wind slabs on the slope and\nthe presence of a cliff below them and to the left.\n    At approximately 4:30 p.m., Skier 1 traveled onto a slope just to skier\u2019s left of 261 and\ntriggered an avalanche. He yelled to his friends and pointed his skis downhill, skied\ndirectly over the cliff he had observed, and landed on the slopes below. While Skier\n1 attempted to keep his airway clear, the avalanche immediately began to bury him.\n    Skiers 2 and 3 were above and out of the main start zone when the slide released.\nThey quickly did a visual search of the terrain above the cliff and then descended a\nsparsely treed area to the north of the avalanche. Once they arrived below the cliff,\n they visually searched the debris field and found a ski pole on the surface and the tip\nof a ski sticking out of the snow just downhill.\n    Skier 3 began assembling his avalanche shovel and instructed Skier 2 to begin\ndigging with his hands in the direction of the victim\u2019s head. They very quickly uncov-\nered a hand that allowed them to locate and uncover Skier 1\u2019s face. He was attempting\nto yell, but his airway was clogged with snow. From the time the avalanche released to\nclearing the victim\u2019s airway was less than five minutes. Skier 1 was lying on his back,\nwith his head approximately 18 inches below the surface. Despite the relatively shal-\nlow burial, he could not move nor extricate himself.\n    After uncovering their teammate, the group recognized the potential overhead\nhazard from additional avalanches and chose to move. Despite his injuries\u2014the skier\nhad two broken bones in his left shoulder and a torn ACL\u2014he was able to slide down-\nvalley to a flat area. At this point, skier 1\u2019s knee injury made further travel challenging.\n    No one in the team had cell service. Skier 3 left the group to descend to the ski\narea and seek help, while Skier 2 remained with the patient. Alpental Patrol was noti-\nfied at about 5:15 p.m. and responded to the scene. They were able to load Skier 1 into\na sled and extricate him to the base of the ski resort.\n\nANALYSIS\nIn a forecast issued at 6:43 p.m. on April 9, the evening before this incident, the\navalanche danger above and near treeline was rated Considerable on all aspects. The\nsummary that evening read: \u201cAnother potent storm will impact Snoqualmie Pass,\nresulting in dangerous avalanche conditions on Saturday. Unstable snow, recent\nhuman-triggered avalanches, and dynamic springtime weather should lead you to\ndial back your terrain choices and avoid slopes over 35 degrees.\u201d\n    Alpental Patrol and Northwest Avalanche Center (NWAC) staff visited the site\nthe next day to complete an investigation. They found that a soft slab avalanche had\nbegun on northwest-facing slope with a start zone averaging 40\u00b0. The crown was 10\nto 12 inches deep, and the slide was about 150 feet wide and ran 350 vertical feet. In a\npit, the investigators found that 10 to 12 inches of storm snow from the night before\nhad slid on a thin layer of small facets. A storm the previous Wednesday night had\ndelivered up to 16 inches of snow near Snoqualmie Pass, along with strong winds.\n    The NWAC forecast from the evening before this incident reported, \u201cOn Friday,\nmultiple skier-triggered avalanches occurred at Snoqualmie Pass, including an involve-\nment where a skier was caught and carried.\u201d The report continued, \u201cAs we navigate our\nway through springtime weather, the transitions between dry and wet avalanche prob-\nlems can be rapid and unpredictable, just like the weather. It can make decision-making\nand forecasting challenging, since you can\u2019t bring your winter mindset or spring mind-\nset to the mountains to rely on for any given day.\u201d (Source: Northwest Avalanche Center.)\n\nRESORT ACCESS TO THE BACKCOUNTRY: Before skiers and riders leave a resort\nthrough a backcountry access gate, they need to flip a mental switch and acknowledge\nthey are entering unpatrolled slopes with all the hazards of backcountry travel, requir-\ning all appropriate training and rescue gear. Sidecountry skiing and riding (resort-\naccessed backcountry touring) accounted for about 10 percent of all U.S. avalanche\nfatalities over the last decade.\n",

Both\nindividuals had many years of backcountry experience, carried avalanche rescue\ngear, and were familiar with the area.\n   The avalanche occurred shortly after they reached the top of their intended\ndescent route (immediately below a ridgeline) and were preparing to descend. Both\nriders were carried down the slope by the slide. The skier was pinned and buried\nagainst a tree within 20 to 30 feet. The snowboarder was swept through the trees\nand partially buried some distance down the slope.\n   The snowboarder extracted himself and immediately began a transceiver search,\nbut the device malfunctioned. At this point, he began to dig in the most likely burial\nlocation and exposed a ski pole, which led to the buried victim. Approximately 25 to\n30 minutes had passed between the burial and extrication.

        "Details_Factors": "Perceived \u2018Safer\u2019 Area\nUtah, Wasatch Mountains, Mill Creek Canyon\nOn the morning of February 6, 2021, two different groups (eight people total) went to\nski the Wilson Glades, a north-facing, 500-foot run just below the 9,950-foot summit\nof Wilson Peak. On the day of the accident, the avalanche danger was rated as High\nfor northeast-facing terrain above 9,500 feet.\n    Chris, Sarah, Louis, Thomas, and Steve (Group A) approached from Big Cotton-\nwood Canyon. While ascending Wilson Peak, Group A noticed a very large natural\navalanche in the Wilson Chutes on the east side of the peak. They posted a photo of\nthis avalanche on Instagram and tagged the Utah Avalanche Center at 8:33 a.m. At\nthe top, they discussed how to ski Wilson Glades but never discussed if they should\nski it or not. They discussed avoiding the steeper sections and going one at a time,\nwith everyone participating in that discussion. Once the group reached the bottom\nof the Wilson Glades, they started breaking a trail back to the top to ski again.\n    Nate, Ethan, and Steph (Group B) approached from Mill Creek Canyon, starting at\n8:30 a.m. Group B saw several natural avalanches in Alexander Basin while ascend-\ning their route into the Wilson Glades. Group B was aware that the avalanche danger\nwas rated High and that Wilson Glades could avalanche. Their general plan for the\nday was to avoid avalanche terrain, and their specific travel plan was to stop at some\npoint before the steeper section, and discuss where to go and what to ski. Ethan and\nSteph were familiar with the area, while it was Nate\u2019s first time skiing the Wilson\nGlades. Neither group dug a snow pit to investigate the snowpack.\n    Group B reached the bottom of Wilson Glades and noted many ski tracks and a\nrecent skin track, which they started to follow uphill. When Nate and Ethan reached a\npoint where they could see the steeper slopes above them, they waited in a sparse\nopening in the trees for Steph.\n    Group A skied the Wilson Glades a total of three times. After their second lap, Steve\nopted to wait above. Following the third lap, they began ascending with the intent to\nfinish the day by skiing back to the trailhead in Big Cottonwood Canyon. At the steep-\nest part of their track, they regrouped at a large tree to cross the final slope one at a\ntime. Chris went first. He reported hearing something that sounded like an earthquake.\nThe avalanche broke approximately 30 feet above them, and Sarah, Thomas, and Louis\nwere swept downhill. Chris lunged for a tree and hit it so hard that the \u201cwind was\nknocked out of him.\u201d Both skis were ripped off his feet, and he was left hanging above\nthe bed surface after the avalanche passed. (It is very unusual that someone can hang\nonto a tree in an avalanche as Chris did.)\n    As Group A was caught in the avalanche, Ethan and Nate (Group B) looked up\nand saw a wall of snow coming at them. Nate initially thought the avalanche would\nnot reach them, but then remembers the snow overtaking him and Ethan and being\nburied as the debris stopped moving. He quickly lost consciousness.\n    Chris dropped out of the tree and screamed for Steve, on the ridge above, to come\ndown. Chris turned his transceiver to receive and began searching downhill on foot\nin a zigzag pattern. Chris acquired a transceiver signal, deployed his avalanche probe,\nand quickly located a person. Chris and Steve dug down four to six feet and uncovered\nNate\u2014someone they didn\u2019t know\u2014who was unconscious but breathing. Chris and Steve\n then located and uncovered Ethan a\nfew feet away and at the same depth\u2014\nanother skier they were surprised to\nsee. Ethan, too, was unconscious but\nbreathing. At 11:40 a.m., Chris called\n911 and provided brief details about the\navalanche and location.\n    Chris then acquired another trans-\nceiver signal approximately 150 feet\nto the east. Chris, Steve, and Nate\n(who by then had joined the search)\nlocated and uncovered Sarah, Louis,\nand Thomas in succession; they were\nburied approximately 30 feet apart\ndown the fall line at a depth of four to six Position of eight skiers after the Wilson Glades\n                                             avalanche. (The skin track is shown in red.) All but\nfeet. None was breathing or had a pulse,\n                                             one of them were skinning up the slope when the\nand after attempting CPR on Sarah, no slide occurred. Utah Avalanche Center\nfurther lifesaving measures were taken.\nChris and Steve then acquired a signal 100 feet to the west. They found Steph buried\nabout six feet deep. She was likewise not breathing and did not have a pulse.\n    By the time all six people had been dug out of the debris (two alive and four deceased),\nmultiple helicopters were circling above with rescue personnel on board. Chris, Nate,\nEthan, and Steve were hoisted off the scene. With darkness approaching, operations\nwere discontinued until the following day, when recovery efforts were completed.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Wilson Glades have seen many close calls. It is perceived as relatively safe\ncompared with nearby areas, because it is less steep. It seldom avalanches naturally;\nas in this incident, slides seem more often human triggered.\n    Analysis of the crown pro\ufb01le revealed the slide was caused by a four-inch-thick\nweak layer of faceted snow formed during periods of cold, dry weather. It was buried\nthree feet deep under the hard slab that failed. The crown was nearly 1,000 feet wide.\nThe slope angle where the crown profile was recorded was 31 degrees, as was the slope\nwhere most of the ski tracks from Group A were located. Their uphill skin track was a\ntouch steeper. Any slope above 30 degrees is considered avalanche terrain.\n    All the skiers except Chis had one or both skis still attached to their feet when they\nwere buried, which may have contributed to deeper burials. Because they were all\nskinning uphill, the toe pieces of their bindings were likely in the walking or locked posi-\ntion, making it diffcult for the skis to release from their feet. In a study of avalanche\nfatalities in the U.S. between 2009 and 2017, avalanche forecaster Evelyn Lees found\nthat 32 percent of fatalities among tourers happened during the ascent. Her study\nstresses the need to find safe ascent routes.\n    Chris and Steve saved two lives (Nate and Ethan), and Chris, Nate, and Steve gave\ntheir best attempt to save the rest. Their rescue efforts were top-notch, and they knew\nhow to perform companion rescue quickly and efficiently. They did the absolute best\nanyone could do with six full burials.

        "Details_Factors": "Terrain Trap\nWyoming, Grand Teton National Park, Broken Thumb Couloir\nOn February 22, 2021, a group of two splitboarders and one skier toured from Taggart\nLake trailhead up 25 Short (so named because the peak is 25 feet short of 10,000) to\ndescend the Broken Thumb Couloir into Avalanche Canyon. This is a very narrow\nchute, and the descent normally involves a 50- to 100-foot rappel in the lower half.\n   A little after 11 a.m., a 33-year-old rider was leading the group down through steep\ntrees and rocky terrain to the entrance of the couloir when he triggered an avalanche\nthat carried him down the confined, rocky couloir and over the rappel zone. He was\ncarried about 800 vertical feet and stopped by a tree, suffering significant trauma,\nand was buried. His friends located him with a transceiver but could not revive him.\n   The avalanche was a recent wind slab estimated at 150 to 200 feet wide and two\nfeet deep at the maximum. It ran 1,100 vertical feet. This relatively small avalanche\noccurred directly above steep, rocky, and vertical terrain and took the snowboarder\non an unsurvivable fall.\n\nANALYSIS\nAll the individuals involved in this incident had at least a Level 1 avalanche class and\nsignificant experience in avalanche terrain.\n    Beginning February 12, snow fell daily in this area up to February 22, with an esti-\nmated 65 inches recorded at the Surprise Meadow snow station, about two miles\nnorth of the accident site. In the week prior, many avalanches were reported in Grand\nTeton National Park. The Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center\u2019s hazard rating for Febru-\nary 22 was Considerable (Level 3 out of 5).\n    This accident occurred on serious terrain above a large cliff. Due to the expo-\nsure, this was not only an avalanche accident but also a mountaineering accident.\nTwo other avalanche fatalities happened in the Bridger-Teton forecast area earlier\nin the same week, and all of them occurred in steep terrain exposed to terrain traps.\n    On February 17, a group of nine snowmobilers was riding in the Salt River Range,\nsoutheast of Alpine, when a soft slab avalanche caught seven members of the party.\nTwo were buried and rescued, but one was swept with his sled into a treed area at\nthe base of the slope and was buried in four to five feet of debris.\n    On February 18, a group six snowboarders built a jump above a steep bank in the\nbackcountry near Togwotee Pass. A 31-year-male made the first jump and triggered\na slab avalanche on the 42-degree bank. He was carried to the creek bottom at the\nbase of the bank and was buried under nine feet of avalanche debris.\n    When natural and human-triggered avalanches are happening, terrain selection\nis essential.

        "Details_Factors": "Inconsistent Snow Depth\nMontana, Absaroka Range, Republic Mountain\nOn the morning of January 8, 2021, a group of six skiers (one female and five males)\nmet in Cooke City and decided to ski the Fin on Republic Mountain. None of them\nhad been to this particular slope or mountain before. All members carried an\navalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, and three were wearing helmets. Two\n carried avalanche airbag packs. All had\nat least some avalanche education. They\nhad read the local avalanche forecast\nthe day before, but not the day of this\nincident (the danger had not changed).\n    On their ascent, visibility was poor\nand they could not see the entire slope\nor the ridgeline they intended to climb.\nAs they left the trees, they dug two pits\nand performed [stability] tests.

However,\n                                             The slide swept three skiers into the trees. Gallatin\nwe knew if we skinned along the ridge National Forest Avalanche Center\nto the southwest, the snowpack would\nchange due to wind exposure. We discussed mitigating this by skinning close to the\nridge and skiing back down our skin track if we saw warning signs.\u201d\n    As they continued and \u201cwhen those in the skin track crossed over a wind lip into a\nslightly more southerly aspect,\u201d they felt the slope collapse and watched a crack prop-\nagate 250 feet upslope. The avalanche broke 1.5 to two feet deep, 200 feet wide, and\nran 700 feet vertically. Skiers 1 and 2 were carried the full distance to the base of the\nslope. Skier 3 was carried about midway downslope. Skier 4 was at the edge of the slide\nand able to hold their position, and Skiers 5 and 6 were further back in the skin track.\n    Skier 1 deployed his airbag and was partially buried. He freed himself from the\ndebris and began a transceiver search. He followed the signal to Skier 2, whose head\nwas buried more than two feet deep; the skier was unconscious and not breathing.\nSkier 1 cleared Skier 2\u2019s airway, and Skier 2 began breathing and regained conscious-\nness. Skier 2 sustained injuries to his leg, but later made it out under his own power.\n    Skiers 4, 5, and 6 quickly skied down to help Skier 3, who was partially buried\nabout halfway down the slide path and sustained serious injuries to his ribs and\nlungs. Skiers 4 and 6 had two-way radios and called for help. (There is no cell service\nin this region.) They were able to contact someone with a radio in Cooke City, who\nreported it to Park County Search and Rescue. Because Skier 3 could not move, the\ngroup eventually congregated at Skier 3\u2019s position, where they built a fire and waited\nfor rescuers. Skier 3 was evacuated by helicopter at about 4 p.m., and the rest of the\nparty was able to get out under their own power with the help of rescuers.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe avalanche occurred on an east aspect at 9,700 feet. The average slope angle was\n37 degrees (33 degrees at the crown). The mountains near Cooke City had received\nheavy snow in October and November, which formed a dense, two- to four-foot-deep\nsnowpack on many slopes. In late November to December, minimal snowfall and cold\ntemperatures led to the formation of weak layers of sugary facets on some slopes,\nespecially where the snowpack was relatively shallow. These layers were buried by\n subsequent heavy snowfall in late December, followed by small storms through the\nfirst week of January.\n    The skiers dug a six-foot-deep snow pit close to where the avalanche was trig-\ngered. They found good snow structure and good stability in their pit, which inves-\ntigators confirmed the next day when they dug in the same spot. Approximately 100\nfeet away, with a slight change in aspect, the snowpack thinned from six feet to two to\nthree feet deep. This thin area is where they initiated a fracture in the faceted grains.\n    In a video produced at the accident scene and in comments to viewers, Doug\nChabot of Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center said the snowpack was mostly\nsix feet or deeper in the mountains around Cooke City at the time, but thinned in\nplaces at higher elevations and among rocky terrain. \u201cBe really careful and paying\nattention to if the snowpack is changing as you\u2019re skinning along,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon\nas [these skiers] wrapped around to a slightly different aspect, the depth and snow\nstructure changed. A stability test is one of many pieces of info that goes into deciding\nwhether to ski or not. A poor test result is enough to turn around, yet the absence of\nthat is not a green light to move forward. Other things have to be going your way to\ngive your decision weight.... The bottom line is that you should know that the snow\nis very stable if you are considering entering large, highly consequential avalanche\nterrain like the Fin.\u201d (Source: Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center.)",

Rider 1 traveled on a splitboard, while Skier 2 was on\nlightweight touring skis. Since their plan was to ski up and descend the snow-covered\nSnodgrass Road, with no exposure to avalanche terrain, they chose not to bring their\navalanche rescue equipment.\n    At the top of the road, they changed plans and decided to descend much steeper\nterrain off Snodgrass Mountain to the north. A friend had traveled off the north side\nthe day prior and reported great conditions. The couple recognized they were ill-\nequipped for travel in avalanche terrain, but they proceeded.\n    From near the summit, they descended a steep, forested slope. Travel through\nthe weak, faceted snowpack was difficult, and they hit many rocks and stumps. They\ndescended about 1,000 vertical feet and arrived at the top of an open slope around\n10,000 feet in elevation. Skier 2 watched while Rider 1 descended first. He made one\nturn and the slope avalanched. He was pulled into the flowing snow, and Skier 2\nquickly lost sight of him.\n    The avalanche flowed through a band of small trees. Rider 1 was slammed into a\nfour- to five-inch-diameter tree, and the impact broke his leg. Rider 1 was wrapped\naround the tree, unburied, and alert when the avalanche stopped.\n    Skier 2 followed her husband\u2019s track onto the bed surface of the avalanche and\ncarefully switchbacked down until she heard him call out and skied straight to his\nposition lower on the slope. He was bleeding significantly and unable to walk. Despite\npoor cell coverage, Skier 2 was able to place a call to 911 at 2:26 p.m. A medical helicop-\nter was able to land near the toe of the avalanche and pick up Rider 1 at about 4 p.m.\n ANALYSIS\nThe soft slab avalanche broke on a layer\nof faceted snow capped by a thin layer\nof surface hoar, and it released broadly:\nabout 300 feet across the full width of\nthis small avalanche path.

This is a steep,\neast-facing slope below treeline that is dissected by two cliff bands in the avalanche\nstart zone.\n    Skiers 1 and 2 had exited the Vail ski area through a backcountry access gate\naround 10:15 a.m. They hiked east for about 30 minutes and then descended along\nthe ridgeline to the north to reach the top of the large, open bowl of Marvin\u2019s West.\nThey arrived at around 10:55 a.m.\n    Skier 1 made his way down through a series of cliff bands to a bench about 800\nvertical feet below the ridge and waited there for Skier 2. The second skier began her\ndescent and skied about 300 vertical feet, down to a narrow opening through a cliff\nband, and then triggered a large avalanche that broke above her. She tried to escape\nto the trees and managed to stay upright, and she came to a stop on the apron below\nthe cliff band, buried to her knees in avalanche debris.\n     Skier 2 descended the debris field, observing that Skier 1 was not at their rendez-\nvous point and that the avalanche had run well past the bench where he was supposed\nto be waiting. She switched her transceiver to receive and headed in the direction\nof the rendezvous point. Skier 2 located her partner and began digging. Skier 1 was\nfound buried 2.5 to 3 feet deep. Skier 2 cleared the snow from around his head and\nshoulders. He was not breathing. This was about 10 minutes after the avalanche.\n    Skier 2 called Vail Ski Patrol at 11:20 a.m. to report the accident. Three other side-\ncountry tourers were riding in an area just east of Marvin\u2019s West. They made their way\nto the scene, where they helped dig Skier 1 from the avalanche debris.

Travel habits developed\nduring usual conditions do not always work during periods when avalanches are\nbreaking wider and running further than you have previously witnessed.\n    Vegetation and terrain can be more reliable than recent memory to determine\nsafer areas. Look for the trim lines of the avalanche path\u2014these are the areas where\n larger trees are still standing. You can also look for trees that are flagged, with all of\nthe uphill branches ripped off by successive avalanches. In the area where Skier 1 was\nwaiting, there are only small, sparse trees. The trim lines are far away, which means\nthat historically avalanches have overrun this area. In the early 1990s, an avalanche\nhere ran the entire way to the valley bottom and put debris on Interstate 70.\n    Safe travel techniques include regrouping outside of avalanche run-out zones,\nparticularly when large avalanches are likely. In some situations, that may mean leap-\nfrogging your partner in small sections, or deciding not to travel through a specific\narea because there are no safe places to regroup. In this particular avalanche path,\nthere are not many safe places to stop and regroup, and it is not a safe place to be\nwhen the avalanche danger is Considerable.

At about 9 a.m., Rider 1 got his first view of\nPat\u2019s Knob, a steep slope on the east side of Mt. Trelease, and saw the aftermath of\na large and recent avalanche. There was no sign of the person ahead of him. Rider 1\nnoticed a skin track higher than normal on the slope. Most of it had been destroyed\nby the avalanche, but there was a small portion left.\n    Two skiers also approaching the area got their first view of the avalanche just before\n9:30 a.m. Skier 1 called 911, reported the slide, and then raced ahead of Skier 2 to begin\nsearching the debris. When Skier 1 arrived at the avalanche debris, Rider 1 was already\nsearching with his transceiver below the remaining skin track. Skier 2 arrived, and the\nthree tourers coordinated rescue efforts.

The team was worried about overhead hazard,\nand without finding a signal, they decided to discontinue their search.\n    The riders remained nearby and talked by phone with the 911 dispatch center,\nLoveland Ski Patrol, and Alpine Rescue Team. Meanwhile, the Clear Creek County\nSheriff matched vehicle registrations of cars in the parking area with all people in the\narea. They identified one missing person and tried reaching him on his cell phone.\nAfter repeated calls went unanswered, the Sheriff\u2019s Office used the cell signal to\nobtain the coordinates of the phone. These were relayed to the riders at the scene.\nUsing Google Maps on his phone, Skier 2 directed the group to the coordinates,\nwhere they saw an avalanche airbag sticking out of the snow. Rider 2 was buried on\nthe downhill side of a few trees. Skier 1 dug out the subject\u2019s head, cleared his airway,\nand monitored the patient for breathing and a pulse but found neither.\n    Alpine Rescue Team members and Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC)\nforecasters arrived on scene at about 12:35 p.m. They determined they could not\nprovide additional care to Rider 2. They searched the avalanche debris with trans-\nceivers, by spot probing, and with a Recco detector, but did not find additional people\nin the debris.\n                                                         ANALYSIS\n                                                        The crown face of this avalanche was\n                                                        up to 20 feet deep and 850 feet wide,\n                                                        and debris ran 500 vertical feet.

Colorado Avalanche Information Center Area recorded 39 inches of snow, with\n                                                        measurable snowfall 10 out of 11 days.\nThere were consistent westerly winds throughout this period.\n     The CAIC rated the backcountry avalanche danger in the Front Range zone at\nConsiderable at all elevations on the day of the accident. A Special Avalanche Advi-\nsory (SAA) had been issued for the Front Range zone on February 12. It read, in part,\n\u201cAvalanche conditions are unusual. Backcountry travelers can trigger avalanches\nthat may break very wide and run the full length of the avalanche path. Your normal\nroutes and safety habits may not keep you out of a dangerous avalanche.\u201d\n     Early snowfall in this area followed by dry weather had produced a layer of very\nweak depth hoar snow. Snowfall from mid-December to early January buried this\nweak snow layer and built a slab of stronger snow on top. Subsequent periods of dry\nweather allowed weak faceted snow to form on the snow surface, which was then\nburied by the next snowstorm or wind-loading event. This pattern repeated, and by\nthe second week of February, the snowpack contained several weak layers of faceted\nsnow between harder, strong slabs. All of these layers were resting on the very weak\nlayer of depth hoar near the ground.\n     This avalanche ran over a well-used skin track. During unusual snowpack condi-\ntions, \u201cnormal\u201d routes and what are considered safe spots must be re-evaluated.\n     Traveling alone in avalanche terrain increases the consequences if you are caught.\nAlthough this was a very large avalanche, Rider 2\u2019s head was buried only a foot beneath\nthe snow surface. A partner that was not in the avalanche may have quickly rescued\nRider 2. However, the rider did have traumatic injuries, so we don\u2019t know if a speedy\nrecovery would have produced a different outcome.\n     The subject was wearing an avalanche airbag but no avalanche rescue transceiver.\nIt is likely Rider 1 would have recovered Rider 2 much faster if the rider was wearing\na transceiver. We recommend you always wear a transceiver when you are traveling\nin avalanche terrain, even if you are by yourself. There is always a chance another\ngroup could rescue you, and it will help search and rescue groups find you and return\n your remains to your family if you are killed in the mountains.\n     Rider 2 deployed his avalanche airbag, which may have kept him from being buried\ndeeper, but it did not keep his head from being buried under the snow. When rescuers\nfound Rider 2, he was wearing the sternum strap on his airbag pack but not the leg\nloop. The sternum strap was pushed up against his neck. As with any safety device,\nit is important to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Most airbags come with a\nleg loop to prevent the pack\u2019s sternum strap from sliding up and posing a choking\nhazard. It also keeps your upper body closer to the bag.\n     The other backcountry tourers in the area on this Sunday morning made valiant\nefforts. Skiers 1 and 2 and Rider 1 alerted 911 immediately and coordinated their own\nrescue effort before organized rescue arrived. The three tourers\u2019 actions led to the\nrelatively quick recovery of the victim and an efficient clearing of the accident site.\n(Source: Colorado Avalanche Information Center.)\n\n\n",

        "Details_Factors": "|\n\nAt around 7 a.m. on Wednesday, February 3, 2021, a New Hampshire Fish and Game\nofficer contacted the Mount Washington Avalanche Center to ask for assistance in\nlocating the vehicle of an individual who had been reported missing the previous\nnight. Ian Forgays, a 54-year-old male from Vermont, had texted friends on Monday,\nFebruary 1, to say he planned a day of backcountry skiing on the west side of Mt.\nWashington, either in Ammonoosuc Ravine or Monroe Brook, prior to the start of a\nsignificant winter storm arriving that night.\n    Forgays\u2019 vehicle was found at the Ammonoosuc Ravine trailhead at 10 a.m. on\nWednesday morning. A ground search was organized while team leaders analyzed\ntexts and photos the subject sent to friends in order to produce a likely timeline\nof events; this helped focus efforts on the area surrounding Ammonoosuc Ravine.\nAvalanche hazard on Wednesday morning was forecast as Considerable, following\nHigh danger the previous day. Light freezing rain and snow showers were falling at\nhigher elevations in the search area. Small teams of three or four were sent to several\nlikely locations to begin the ground search.\n    By early afternoon, advanced cell phone forensics narrowed the last known point\nof the subject\u2019s cell phone to an area almost directly above the main drainage of the\nAmmonoosuc. As searchers left the hiking trail and made their way up the drainage,\nthey found debris and some broken trees that were evidence of recent slide activity,\nmost likely from a widespread avalanche cycle on Tuesday, one day after the subject\nskied the area. At 4:25 p.m., a beacon signal was acquired by a searcher with a dog\nand Recco receiver beneath the largest west-northwest-facing slope of the Ammo-\nnoosuc, at around 3,950 feet. Pinpoint search techniques with an avalanche trans-\nceiver located a beacon signal 3.8 meters (12 feet 6 inches) beneath the debris, which\nhad piled up against the face of an overhanging rock buttress.\n    Rescuers began to dig and probe, and as more rescuers arrived and lowered\nthe grade of the snow by more than a meter, a probe strike was finally confirmed.\nEight rescuers took turns digging for an hour and 35 minutes. When they reached\nthe subject\u2019s body, the teams extricated it from the deep hole, lowered the subject\ndown two pitches of steep snow and ice, and then shifted to a SKED rescue litter\nfor transport to the road. An autopsy later identified asphyxia as the cause of death.\n\nANALYSIS\nTexts to the Forgays\u2019 friends stated that he planned to \u201ctake advantage of low avy\ndanger and low winds up high,\u201d prior to the onset of the winter storm. By 9 a.m. on\nMonday, the skier had reached treeline on Mt. Monroe, and by 11 a.m. he was near\nthe summit of Mt. Washington. He then headed for the ravine.\n    On the day the subject went skiing, the avalanche danger for the area was rated\nas Low. Conditions included a mix of snow surfaces, ranging from ice to rimed snow\nto firm wind slabs, all of which are commonplace in the wind-raked alpine areas and\nsteep ravines of the Presidential Range. The layers beneath included a widespread,\nwind-hammered surface dubbed the \u201c157 Layer,\u201d after the 157 mph peak wind speed\non January 24 that helped create it. Above that layer was another, softer wind slab,\n described in the February 1 forecast as\n\u201c\u2026smooth, hollow sounding slabs (that)\nare easy to identify.\u201d The Bottom Line of\nthe forecast stated, \u201cThe potential for\nsmall avalanches of wind-drifted snow\nremains in isolated areas at mid and\nupper elevations.\u201d\n    It is likely that Forgays triggered\none of these isolated pockets and then\nwas carried into a bowl-like depression,\nwhere the snow was stopped by an over-\nhanging cliff that was angled upslope.\nThe debris pile here was deep but fairly\nnarrow, fanning out from a 10-foot strip\nto about 25 feet wide by 40 feet long.\n    The week prior to Forgays\u2019 burial had\nbrought only four inches of snow total to\nthe Mt. Washington summit, with rela-\ntively low wind speeds. The cold nights\nand some wind loading did create slabs,\nbut they were relatively small in size. An\nexamination of the crown of the Forgays A rescuer begins to probe just after a Recco\navalanche wasn\u2019t possible, since extreme and beacon search found a signal four meters\nwinds and new snow the following day beneath the snow in Ammonoosuc Ravine. The\nerased all the signs. Weather factors and avalanche path is the narrow strip of snow in\n                                            the background, between the ice on the left and\nobservations from other areas suggest a\n                                            the boulders on the right. Mount Washington\nsmall (D1) wind slab was most likely.       Avalanche Center\n    Information provided by family and\nfriends indicates that Forgays had skied Mt Washington hundreds of times. His choice\nto ski that day seems informed and intentional, and his past ski missions with friends\nreflected an enthusiasm for any sort of skiing adventure.\n    Accidents like this serve as a stark reminder of the role that luck can play in our\nbackcountry endeavors. Finding a triggerable slab in mostly safe avalanche conditions\nis rare but not unheard of, especially due to our [local] mountains\u2019 spatially variable\nwind slab avalanche problem. Accurately assessing snow and terrain and avoiding\ntrouble throughout a lifetime of playing in the mountains is a tremendous challenge\nfor anyone, even for the most experienced.\n    A skiing partner might have saved Ian Forgays\u2019 life when he triggered a small\nwind slab, but given the terrain trap below, maybe not. Forgays was equipped with\navalanche safety gear, including an avalanche transceiver, which helped rescuers and\nthe family immensely. But it is important to remember that even the most experi-\nenced skiers with all the correct preparations and equipment risk more when skiing\nalone. If there are lessons to be learned from this accident, they aren\u2019t new. Skiing\ntechnical lines, in a thin snowpack above a notorious terrain trap, with no partners,\neven on a Low danger day, raises the stakes tremendously.

An approximately six-inch slab of new and wind-deposited snow released\nfrom Skier 2\u2019s feet as Skier 1 made their first turn. Skier 1 was swept into and under\nthe moving debris and lost their skis and poles. When the flow stopped, Skier 1 was\nburied face-down, fortunately with their head very near the surface and able to\nbreathe, while the rest of their body was buried by two feet or more of debris.\n    Skier 2 located their friend, but without a shovel was unable to dig them out.\nBystanders closer to the scene began to dig out Skier 1, and others, alerted by Skier\n2, soon came to assist.\n\nANALYSIS\nJust prior to the avalanche, a snow ranger suggested to the two skiers, who did not\nhave beacons, shovels, or probes, that they ski the lower-angled slope between Right\nGully and Lobster Claw or the lower section of Left Gully\u2014if they skied anything at\nall. They later told snow rangers that the excitement of new snow drove them to the\ntop of Left Gully, where the incident then unfolded. These two were very helpful to\nthe community by honestly sharing their story with snow rangers.\n     There were no natural avalanches reported that day, which carried a Moderate\ndanger rating. (The forecast did include possible human triggering of small wind\nslabs.) This pair was among many poorly equipped skiers or skiers traveling alone.\nReading the forecast carefully, applying safe travel techniques, and carrying the\nproper equipment are fundamental to recreating in avalanche terrain. It is critical to\nacknowledge that the majority of avalanche incidents and fatalities occur on Moder-\nate danger-rating days, where there may isolated but large avalanches or widespread,\nsmaller avalanches, such as the one on this day. Both can carry real consequences.\n     Of interest following this event were the readings from Skier 1\u2019s GPS watch: It\nrecorded a total vertical drop during the avalanche of 850 feet and a maximum speed\nof 53 mph.

The climber first clipped in with the end of his tether\nsling (left). He then tried to shorten his tether by clipping a shorter loop created by an overhand knot\ntied in the sling. However, he failed to capture the shorter loop (right). Under load, the knot initially\njammed in the base of the carabiner. It temporarily held his weight, but then pulled through. Tim Parker\naround both hard points on his harness. Parker had pre-rigged the tether with two\noverhand knots, dividing the sling into three segments to allow for various clip-in\npoints and for extending his rappel device. He used a locking carabiner to clip the\ntether into the shelf of the cordelette anchor. Unbeknownst to him, the carabiner was\nnot properly clipped to his tether, but this fact would not be revealed for a moment.\nParker did a visual double-check of his connection, asked for slack, and weighted the\nnew system. With nearly full body weight on the tether and the carabiner locked, he\ntold Mullen to take him off belay. After doing so, she walked around the formation to\nNightstalker\u2019s base, where she began packing their gear.\n   Meanwhile, Parker untied from the rope and threaded it through the rappel\nanchors, then pulled the rope through the rings until both ends were on the ground.\nApproximately five minutes after taking her partner off belay, Mullen heard a yell\nand watched Parker fall from the top of the climb. He free-fell approximately 60 feet,\nthen fell another 30 feet down lower-angled rock (70\u201380\u00b0) before hitting the ground.\n   Mullen found him lying on his back. His head was about one foot away from a\nsmall boulder. A trained Wilderness First Responder, Mullen stabilized Parker until\na nearby climbing party arrived to help. The other climbers dialed 911 at 5 p.m. The\nclimbers helped take vital signs and stabilize Parker until paramedics arrived at about\n5:30 p.m. He was airlifted to Banner University Medical Center in Tucson.\n    Parker spent about three and a half weeks in the hospital and rehab center, with\nmany broken bones, extensive abrasions, a mild traumatic brain injury, a nearly\nsevered left ear, and nerve damage. After being discharged, Parker spent about two\nand a half months in a wheelchair and another month on crutches. Though still\nrecovering, he was able to return to working on expedition and climbing courses in\nNovember 2021.\n\nANALYSIS\nDue to some memory loss from the accident, the precise cause of the fall\u2014and the five\nto ten minutes leading up to it\u2014can only be hypothesized. Parker believes he initially\nclipped the end of his tether into the cordelette but that this connection was too\nlong to give him easy access to the anchor. He must have tried to shorten his tether\nby clipping the second knotted loop of the sling.\n    After the accident, his locking carabiner remained clipped to the cordelette and\nlocked shut. The tether was not compromised in any way. Parker assumes that when\nhe tried to clip in, he pushed the knot through the opening of the locking carabiner\nbut did not clip the actual loop of webbing. When he weighted the system, it is\nbelieved the knot jammed against the edge of the carabiner just enough to hold his\nweight. Parker\u2019s rappel device was still clipped to a gear loop on his harness after\nthe fall. Likely the knot in the tether popped through the carabiner when his body\nweight shifted as he reached for the device.\n    Parker and Mullen recreated this scenario at home. They noted that while it was\ndifficult to fully weight a knot placed in the carabiner this way, when it was set in\na particular spot the knot could hold weight (especially when lodged in a smaller\nD-shaped locking carabiner). Once loaded, the jammed knot appeared similar to a\nproperly clipped and loaded tether.\n    Many aspects of this accident line up with themes in other descending acci-\ndents. Since this was the last climb of the day, they felt pressure to depart for the\ntwo-hour drive back to Tucson. The couple were also about to start a three-week\noutdoor education course. Such transitions can be stressful and distracting. Parker\nreflected that the accident\u2019s primary cause was complacency, as he ultimately failed\nto catch his own mistake.\n    Other aspects are important as well. Parker had used his tether system many\ntimes, but more often for rappelling multi-pitch climbs. Using a new system\u2014or an\nold system in a new context\u2014raises a yellow flag that should be recognized. Perhaps\nthe better option would have been to rig the system he used more commonly for\ncleaning bolted anchors on sport climbs. The only reason he used the system in\nquestion was because it was already rigged from his previous climb on Nightstalker.\n    Lastly, Parker was not wearing a helmet. This was a conscious decision. Before\nthis accident, he regularly wore a helmet while leading and/or when concerned\nabout overhead hazards. But since Naked Prey is a short, steep pitch on a small\npinnacle of rock, rockfall was not an issue. As he was top-roping, there was little\nto no chance of hitting his head in a fall. Of all of the miracles herein, the greatest\nmight be his avoidance of serious brain damage and/or death. Parker now wears\nhis helmet in all outdoor roped climbing contexts.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nLake Tahoe Area, Cloudburst Canyon, Green Tongue Area\nOn July 17 my girlfriend, Hannah (29), and I (30) went out for a day in an obscure\nclimbing area, just southeast of Lake Tahoe, called Cloudburst Canyon. On my third\nclimb I fell at the crux, ripped three pieces of protection, and fell to the ground.\n    I have been climbing for six years with most of my experience on multi-pitch trad\nmoderates. Ready to push the grades, train harder, and be okay with taking more\nfalls on trad, I jumped right in and looked for some 5.11 trad routes. I had heard of\nCloudburst Canyon from a new friend, Nate. He said the only beta was on Mountain\nProject. We looked and saw several classic climbs in the area, including a 5.11- for me\nto attempt. We arrived, met Nate, and headed into the canyon.\n    After a loose and technical approach, we warmed up on two routes, a 5.9 and then\na 5.10-. Both felt solid, so I turned my eyes toward an obscure route called \u201cUnknown\n11-\u201d. I also saw a 10- directly to the right that shared anchors, which gave me the\noption of setting up a top-rope. I decided against this because of my new mindset.\nI was ready to lead harder climbs and was willing to fall. On the 11- route, the main\nfeature was a lightning-bolt crack zigzagging up the slightly overhanging face. The\nfirst piece of protection was a bolt I could reach from the ground. After that it was\ngoing to be gear placements through the crux, then three bolts to the top.\n    A few moves into the climb, I placed a horizontal 0.3 Camalot in a shallow crack.\nConsidering this route was at my limit, I didn\u2019t feel I had time to make sure it was\nperfect, so I moved on. After five more feet, the gear was getting harder to place. I\nplaced a small offset nut that passed a few tugs and looked decent. I kept climbing. I\nreached a bit of a rest and got another small offset nut above my head. I fired into the\ncrux and got about five or six feet above my last piece when I couldn\u2019t move up safely\nanymore. I did not want to come off desperately reaching for holds, so I yelled \u201cFall-\ning!\u201d as I let go of the wall. I felt tension in the rope and then a \u201cSNAP!\u201d The next thing\n                                                          I knew I was on the ground,\n                                                         about 15 feet downhill from\n                                                         the start of the route.

We\n                                                         quickly realized that getting\n                                                         me out of this remote canyon\n                                                         alone was not realistic. Nate\n                                                         went looking for some climb-\n                                                         ers we had spotted on the\nBelow the crux on Unknown 5.11-.

Nate came\nback with three other climbers. As a team of four, they slowly moved me down the\ntalus, loose rock, ledges, stream crossings, and stinging nettles. The full effort took\nthree hours. I made it to urgent care and had surgery two weeks later.\n\nANALYSIS\nI made three placements that failed on this climb. The highest was a number 2 or 3\nDMM Peenut offfset (rated to 5kN), whose wire broke, leaving the head of the nut\nstill stuck in the rock. Next down was another offset (a number 1 DMM Peenut) that\nripped out of the wall, followed by a number 0.3 Camalot.\n    The first lesson was to understand the limits of my gear. A microwire rated to\n5kN could handle a short fall under perfect circumstances, but I was too close to the\nground with little slack in the rope. I essentially shock-loaded this wire and broke it. I\nlearned to pay attention to the entire system and how each part plays a different role\nin the forces applied to my pieces of protection. Second, as a heavier climber (around\n200 lbs.), I need to start taking fall ratings on gear more seriously. If I am placed in\na situation where small gear is required, I should be nesting and/or placing them\nfrequently instead of relying on one small piece every six feet. The third is to get the\nbest placement possible. If you have doubts, don\u2019t just move past it in the hopes that\nit will hold. If you can\u2019t find good protection, consider lowering or aid climbing.\n    The main lesson I learned was to approach climbing with a more focused and\nsafety-oriented attitude. Over the last six years, I had numbed that sense of caution\nby climbing mostly within my onsight ability. Because I was not taking any falls, I\nslowly built up a false sense of security both in the gear I was placing and my climb-\ning abilities. This laissez-faire attitude was the reason I skipped many safety checks\n that day, which could have made this accident possibly fatal.\n    Considering all the following mistakes I made, I feel extremely lucky with how\nthe accident turned out:\n(1) I skipped the opportunity to climb a much easier route and set up a top-rope in\n    order to get gear and movement beta for a route that was at my onsight limit.\n(2) I was in a new climbing area and did not consider the rock quality. I found out\n    after the fact that the granite in this area and the specific climb was known to be\n    crumbly at the surface.\n(3) I chose to fall instead of simply downclimbing to my piece and resting. If I had\n    done this, the piece would most likely have held and I could have reassessed.\n(4) I chose not to wear a helmet. I had convinced myself the situation didn\u2019t call for\n    it: no climbers above, not a multi-pitch climb, and I chose comfort over safety.\n(5) None of us had a first aid kit, which would have been critical had my injuries been\n    worse.

The slab did not match any route description and so, with his last\npiece of protection 25 to 30 feet below him, Jeff decided to downclimb back to the\nledge. During the downclimb, a flake pulled off as he tested it. Jeff lost his balance\nand fell. He believes he struck the ledge and continued falling for a total of 50 feet.\nThe 0.4 cam caught him.\n    Remarkably, Jeff was able to finish the climb, despite a right ankle fracture and\nsevere bone bruising in the left heel. After bringing up his partner, they contacted\nYosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) to get help with the hike down the Yosemite\nFalls Trail.

        "Details_Factors": "Exposure and Weather\nYosemite National Park, Half Dome\nIn the evening of October 17, two climbers, Kate (28) and Nick (26), started up the\nRegular Northwest Face of Half Dome (23 pitches, 5.9 C2) after completing the Nose\non El Capitan (31 pitches, 5.9 C2) earlier in the same day. Nick and Kate were both\nexperienced climbers attempting a sub-24-hour link-up of the two walls. They failed to\nsummit Half Dome when they were caught in a winter storm, five pitches from the top.\n    After finishing The Nose, Kate and Nick ate lunch and started up the approach\nto Half Dome. The weather forecasted a 90 percent chance of precipitation around\n1:30 a.m. Despite that, neither talked about rescheduling.\n    Kate and Nick started climbing the Northwest Face around 6 p.m. They made\ngood progress, but around midnight they were engulfed in a winter-like storm. At\nthis point, Nick and Kate were simul-climbing through 5.9 and 5.10 terrain, with snow\nand ice accumulating on ledges and in cracks. Around 12:30 a.m., they arrived at Big\nSandy Ledge, atop pitch 18.\n    Nick began leading the first pitch of the \u201cZig Zags\u201d (pitch 19) with increasing diffi-\nculty. He was scraping ice out of the cracks and, at one point, slipped off a large foot\nledge and fell back onto his daisy chain. Their gear was freezing solid, and Kate\u2019s\nhands were losing their ability to function.\u00a0\u00a0\n    Nick still wanted to try and summit, but Kate did not think safely continuing was\npossible. At this point, they had not sustained any injuries, but the pitches ahead\nincluded Thank God Ledge and multiple slab pitches, none of which is inconsequen-\ntial, especially if covered with ice and snow. They called 911 at 1:50 a.m. and were told\n Nick and Kate being hoisted to the summit of Half Dome after a mid-October storm. Big Sandy and\nThank God ledges are clearly outlined below by the plastering of fresh snow. Jack Cramer\nto call back at 6 a.m. In a few hours the snow stopped falling, the wind died down, and\nthe temperature dropped. At first light, the conditions on the route were even icier.\nAt 6 a.m., they called search and rescue back and confirmed they needed assistance.\n    Shortly afterward, Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) gathered for a technical\nrescue on Half Dome. The plan was to fly rescuers, ropes, and all necessary equip-\nment to the summit with a helicopter and lower one member of YOSAR to Nick and\nKate and then haul them up to the summit. Due to the cold winter conditions, the\nhelicopter got delayed because the rotors needed to de-ice.\n    Later that morning, conditions allowed the helicopter to fly. A rescuer was lowered\nto Nick and Kate, carrying jackets and warm beverages. Once the rescuer attached\nto Kate and Nick, two teams on top raised the climbers to the summit. Miraculously,\nneither Kate nor Nick sustained any cold-related injuries.\n\nANALYSIS\nHeed the forecast. Severe storms can roll through Yosemite any month of the year, but\nearly spring and late fall often catch climbers unaware. In this case, the team saw a\nforecast for the Valley floor (4,000 feet elevation) with precipitation starting at 1:30\na.m., and they were surprised when the storm started two hours earlier. The condi-\ntions on Half Dome (8,846 feet) were not surprisingly much more intense and severe.\n    Don\u2019t allow the goal to blind your judgment. The link-up of Half Dome and El Capi-\ntan in under 24 hours is an admirable goal for any Valley climber. After a season of\ntraining and a plan set in motion, it can be tough to decide to bail, especially given\nthat the climbers had completed El Capitan and were \u201con track\u201d for a sub-24-hour\n time. They ignored a known weather risk to complete their goal.\n    Communicate openly with your partner. Many accidents and rescues can be\navoided with better communication between partners. Any reservations or concerns\nshould be immediately communicated. Especially with disappointment on the line,\nit can be challenging to start the conversation. Partners, particularly new partners,\nshould regularly check in and practice their communication like other climbing skills.\nSure, one partner might be disappointed at first, but if it means not having to spend\nthe night in a winter storm or worse, it might be worth it.\n    Although they discussed the weather, there was no conversation about a worst-\ncase scenario. The climbers didn\u2019t discuss the possibility of not making it to the top\nnor what the upper pitches would be like in a storm. The final pitch of the Regular\nNorthwest Face is slab climbing with limited opportunities to aid. There should always\nbe a conversation about how to retreat if there is no real possibility of going up.\n    Pack the proper layers. If you know there is a chance of precipitation, you should\npack suitable layers. Kate and Nick both had warm gloves (Kate was not initially wear-\ning them), base layers, and hardshell jackets. However, neither had hardshell pants,\nand they felt like that was a major mistake. Both Kate and Nick have experience with\nice/mixed climbing in winter conditions and thought they could have possibly self-\nrescued the following morning with the appropriate layers.\n    Know when to call for a rescue (and have the ability to communicate). It\u2019s tough to\nknow when the right time is. Ultimately, Kate decided they should call for help when\nshe felt like she could not safely use her hands. The need for a rescue became more\napparent when they were rappelling back down to Big Sandy after attempting the\nZig-Zags. The ropes were extremely icy, making the rappel dangerous. They rappelled\nwith Grigris and used slings as \u201cthird-hand\u201d backup prusiks, and did not feel it was\nsafe to try and retreat further. There were legitimate concerns that if they attempted\nto continue upward, Kate and/or Nick could have gotten injured; this would have\nmade the situation much worse and the rescue more complex.\n    They only carried one cell phone with them, and fortunately they were able to\nmake a phone call to 911. To communicate with YOSAR, they kept the phone off when\nnot in use and kept the phone next to their bodies to keep it warm and preserve the\nbattery.

I then made an anchor\nby slinging the tree and tethered her with a sling and locking carabiner.\n    I returned to the injured climber and supported her while the belayer slowly\nlowered the climber. We were eventually able to get the injured climber to a safe and\ncomfortable position on the ledge. We then waited for the rescue team.

The party carried no alpine\ndraws, only quickdraws.\n    Failure to adequately protect the route\u2014which is common on easier terrain\u2014likely\ncontributed to the injuries sustained during the fall. However, their limited gear and\nlack of proper belay anchor suggest that they would have benefited from some addi-\ntional education and experience. (Source: Matthew Lee.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Rappel Error\nEcho Cliffs, The Grotto\nMy wife (Kelly Perkins, 59) and I (Craig Perkins, 60) have rock climbed for 20 years. After\na long hiatus, I took time to refresh my skills, including anchor building, knots, and gear\nplacement. Our climb, Miss Pacman (5.9, sport), was fun and initially uneventful. Upon\nreaching the top of the 40-foot route, the open cold-shuts anchors looked worn. Over\nthe years, deep grooves had formed in the metal. I attached two quickdraws to facilitate\n top-roping, one to each shut and clipped the rope-bearing end with the carabiner gates\nopposite and opposing. This minimized wear and tear on the shuts.\n    I decided to rappel from the anchors instead of lowering through the shuts. To\nsecure myself, I attached two quickdraws to my belay loop and clipped one to each\nshut. Once secure, I gave the command, \u201cOff belay.\u201d Still tied in, I unclipped the rope\nfrom the hanging quickdraws and looped it through the open shuts to set up a rappel.\n    I then girth-hitched a Dyneema sling to my belay loop and tied a figure eight on\na bight in the sling (Mistake #1). I slid the end loop over both open shuts (Mistake\n#2). The loop formed by the figure eight was so small that it created a wide angle in\nthe loop (Mistake #3). I did not set up my rappel system before committing myself\nto the sling, nor did I test the sling while belayed or backed up by my anchor quick-\ndraws (Mistake #4).\n    I cleaned the anchor quickdraws and sat back on the Dyneema sling. As I did so,\nthe loop constricted and popped off the open cold shuts. I began falling. My first reac-\ntion was to grab the opposite side of the rope. While this slowed my descent, it also\ncaused a friction burn. I instinctively let go, only to grab the rope again as I picked\nup speed. The rope burn caused me to let go again and I continued to the ground,\nlanding on a flat slab at the base of the climb. Fortunately, my injuries were limited\nto third-degree burns on all fingers of the right hand and two fingers on the left,\nalong with a sprained ankle, scrapes on my back, and a hematoma to my left thigh.\nI was very lucky.\n    My wife and I gathered our belongings and returned to the trailhead after a\none-hour hike. We headed straight to the closest urgent care center, where my\nhands were treated. Suffice to say, this was a lesson learned. I hope this story will\nhelp prevent further accidents of this kind. The event scared the bejesus out of\nmy wife. She initially thought she had made a mistake by taking me off belay. To\nbe clear, she did nothing wrong. Also, she was a trooper by carrying extra weight\nduring our hike out. (Source: Craig Perkins.)\n\nANALYSIS\nOpen cold shuts are thankfully disappearing as anchor hardware gets updated. Unfor-\ntunately, they are still found even on popular climbs. This incident illustrates two\nmajor hazards presented by open cold shuts. First, rope wear on the anchor reduces\ntheir already low relative strength. The second is they are inherently insecure, just\nlike any open anchor.\n    The victim noted that during years of repeated lowering, \u201cdeep grooves had\nformed\u201d in the shuts. Though he made a good choice to top-rope through quickdraws,\na better option would have been to girth-hitch two independent slings (or the two\nends of one long sling) to the shuts and equalize the rope-bearing end.\n    The biggest lesson here is to weight-test the system (in this case the rappel) before\nunclipping from your direct tether to the anchor. A decision to rappel versus lower is\na personal choice. In this case, the complexity of reconfiguring an open anchor was\ninefficient and paradoxically precipitated what might have become a fatal accident.\nThe victim\u2019s desire to create \u201cextra redundant protection\u201d was also unnecessary and,\nagain, exposed him to more risk. In the end, it would have been easier and safer to\nlower through the cold shuts, grooved as they were. (Source: The Editors.)\n",

He started up Granny Goose (5.7), a 50-foot tradi-\ntional route in a well-traveled area. After passing the initial flake on the route, he\nplaced his leg into an offwidth crack, about 30 feet above the ground.\n   Fairly quickly, the climber realized his left leg was stuck. He was well positioned\nwith a cam overhead and an edge for his right foot, and a rock inside the crack allowed\nhim to push off with the left foot, but he still had no luck in releasing the leg. Swell-\ning developed, making the situation more concerning.\n     Since bathroom facilities were nearby, the climber was able to call down to other\nvisitors. He stayed as calm as possible and asked for rangers to be contacted. He then\nlowered a bight of rope for those below to attach a bottle of water and then a pocket\nknife that he had at the base in his pack. He considered their suggestion of lubricating\nhis leg with sunscreen but was concerned the slippery sunscreen would endanger\nfuture climbers on the route. Ultimately, the climber was able to extricate his limb\nafter cutting the leg off his pants and was able to descend safely.\n\nANALYSIS\nMany climbers have experienced the panicked feeling of having a limb become\nstuck on a climb. These usually can be freed by shuffling the foot or removing the\nshoe. This climber managed to stay calm while troubleshooting. He was also well\npositioned, with people available nearby to assist him. Other techniques previously\nused to free stuck limbs include creating anchor systems to lift the weight off the\naffected limb and using lubricants such as dish soap.

He and climbing\npartner Tom Bohanon (65) effected a self-rescue to the nearby access road before\nbeing transported by local SAR to their vehicle. Below is Levy\u2019s edited report:\n    We arrived at the trailhead at 3:45 a.m. The approach took approximately 1 hour\n30 minutes. We left our skis below the snow-covered talus slope leading up to the\nclimb. It was twilight when we began racking up, and it was still difficult to see much\nbeyond the glow of our headlamps.\n    The first pitch was extremely wet, and the ice was poor quality. I made most of my\nupward progress by hooking my tools behind ice petals. I occasionally yelled down\nto Bo (who had climbed the route on six prior occasions) to ask which way I should\ngo. Sixty meters up, I reached a sheltered ice cave and made an anchor with two ice\n                                                    screws in solid blue ice.

Levy\nbelieves his accident was the combination of several bad decisions and bad luck.\n    First, the ice was in poor condition, triggering the fall. Second, the scale of the\nroute and its maze of ice daggers, cauliflowers, and mushrooms led to route-finding\ndifficulties and the choice of the ill-fated line.\n    He also failed to place adequate protection when it was readily available. There\nare two situations while leading water ice when it is essential to stop and place an\nice screw. One is very soon after leaving the belay, and the other is prior to clear-\ning a bulge.\n    Levy\u2019s decision to forgo placing a screw above the anchor was, in his own words,\n\u201cfoolish.\u201d The factor-two fall onto a one-screw anchor (ice axes are inadequate as\nanchors) could have been easily avoided. \u201cI knew I should place a screw above the\nbelay but was intent on conserving my supply. Thankfully the anchor held up, but it\nwas an unnecessary risk.\u201d (Sources: Michael Levy and Tom Bohanon.)",

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Knot Block\nOuray, Camp Bird Road\nOn January 29, veteran climbers Tom Bohanon (65)\nand Wayne McIlwraith (74) experienced a rappel-\nling accident while descending from Chockstone\nChimney (WI3) in the Camp Bird Road area. Injuries\nwere thankfully minor.\n    Bohanon and McIlwraith climbed Chockstone\nChimney (WI3-4) in a single long pitch. They\ndescended via rappel using a single 9.2mm by 70m\nrope paired with a 6mm static retrieval line of the\nsame length. The anchor was webbing with a stain-\nless-steel rappel ring and carabiner at the power\npoint. The two ropes were joined by an overhand\nknot (a.k.a. offset overhand bend) jammed against\nthe rappel ring and carabiner. This technique,\n                                                      Example of an overhand rigged as\nknown as a \u201cknot block,\u201d prevents the rope from       a knot block at a rappel ring. Once\nsliding through the rappel ring and carabiner in      down, the climbers would pull the\none direction but allows it to slide through in the   thinner yellow rope.\n other direction. This would facilitate a rappel of the single 9.2mm while allowing the\nteam to retrieve the ropes.\n    The retrieval line was backed up by a figure 8 knot clipped to the anchor. Boha-\nnon rappelled without incident, using a Grigri on the single 9.2mm. He stopped on\nthe snow slope at the base of the climb (about ten feet above flat terrain). McIlwraith\nsaw no movement in the jammed knot. After Bohanon reached the base, McIlwraith\nuntied the backup and then duplicated the rappel on the single 9.2mm. Meanwhile,\non the snow slope, Bohanon clipped the retrieval line to his harness with two feet\nof slack to act as a backup. He also held the single 9.2mm in a fireman\u2019s belay. McIl-\nwraith rappelled uneventfully and passed Bohanon, who by necessity released the\nfireman\u2019s belay. When he was three feet above flat ground, the knot at the anchor\npopped through the power point and McIlwraith fell backward. He landed on his\nback upon a 20\u00b0 snow slope. The retrieval line came tight on Bohanon\u2019s harness just\nas his partner\u2019s fall/slide ended. McIlwraith experienced a sore back and neck. His\nsymptoms dissipated after a few days.\n\nANALYSIS\nWhile the injuries were minor, the accident illustrates that the most experienced\nclimbers, using tried and true methods, must be ever vigilant on a descent.\n    More than one accident last year involved the failure of a jammed knot, whether\ndeliberate or unintentional (see page 24). Given the myriad types and sizes of carabiners,\nrings, links, hooks, and hangers at anchors, a single strategy won\u2019t address all situations.\nFortunately, this team, with a collective century-plus of climbing experience, main-\ntained a closed system throughout the descent, preempting a more serious accident.\n    In Bohanon\u2019s analysis, the accident might have been prevented by: 1. Using a\ntraditional double rope rappel on matching dynamic ropes; 2. Using a larger stop-\nper knot like a figure eight or double fisherman for the knot block; 3. Rappelling the\nuneven-diameter dynamic and static ropes together using an ATC-style device; 4.\nTying tighter into the retrieval line. (Source: Tom Bohanon.)",

        "Incident_Type": "FALL ON SKIS",
        "Details_Factors": "Failure to Adequately Assess Conditions\nSan Juan Mountains, Wilson Peak\nOn April 20, my partner Scott and I, Alec Orenstein (37), attempted a ski descent of\nthe northeast face (the \u201cCoors Couloir\u201d) of 14,017-foot Wilson Peak near Telluride. We\nbegan our approach via Silver Pick Basin at around 4 a.m. Changing over to crampons,\nwe climbed a short couloir with steep snow and a fourth-class move that topped out\non the southwest ridge of Wilson, and then traversed the ridge (with another fourth-\nclass move) to reach the summit at around 11:30 a.m.\n    At the top, we encountered a skier and splitboarder who had passed us on the way\nup. They said they had traversed down the ridges along both sides of the northeast\nface but could not find a way to enter the face due to low snow coverage. They began\nto descend via the southwest ridge, the same way we had come up.\n    Scott and I descended the westerly of these ridges and stopped above what we\nbelieve is the usual entrance to the Coors Couloir. We discussed the coverage and\nconcluded it would be safer to try to descend the northeast face with skis than to\n reverse the southwest ridge. Part of our thinking\nwas that the other party included a snowboarder,\nwho we judged would have had a much tougher\ntime side-stepping down the top of the couloir,\npossibly explaining why they turned back.\n    I went first and began side-stepping down\nthe face. I had my ski poles in my right (down-\nhill) hand, lashed together with a ski strap, and\nmy ice axe in my left (uphill) hand, self-belay-\ning with each step. I kicked off a small dry loose\navalanche at the top, which did not reveal any\nmore rocks below.\n    About 15 feet below the ridge, I had to move\nleft above a rock band toward what looked like a\nsafe zone where I could wait for Scott. I released\nmy edges slightly to side-slip left and immediately\nhit several large rocks. I released from both bind-\n                                                      About to drop in on the northeast face of\nings (even though I had locked the toes of my tech\n                                                      Wilson Peak. The oval marks the start of\nbindings), fell face-first into the rock band below a 1,200-foot fall. Alec Orenstein\nme, and began sliding fast down the couloir.\n    I tumbled approximately 1,200 feet and came to rest in a large 35\u00b0 snowfield below\nthe couloir. I never lost consciousness. After taking a moment to assess my injuries,\nI called up to Scott to let him know I was conscious. Given my injuries and the fact\nthat I had lost both skis in the valley hundreds of feet below me, I knew I wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to descend back to the car, so I called my wife with my cell phone to tell her\nabout the accident, and she called San Miguel County Search and Rescue.\n    It took Scott more than two hours to descend to me (he had to put his crampons\nback on to descend on foot). The SAR team had arranged a helicopter to do a rescue,\nand at SAR\u2019s direction and with Scott\u2019s heroic help, I part-glissaded, part-stumbled to\na flat spot about 200 vertical feet below, where a helicopter was able to pick me up.\n    My injuries were more minor than they could have been. I broke the transverse\nprocesses of two of my lower vertebrae, two ribs, and the iliac crest of my pelvic\nbone. I suffered a small pneumothorax and deep cuts and abrasions on my torso,\nlegs, and face. I spent the night in the hospital and was mostly recovered after about\neight weeks.\n\nANALYSIS\nIn retrospect, we obviously shouldn\u2019t have tried to descend the couloir on skis,\ngiven the thin coverage. The party ahead of us clearly knew better. I have experi-\nence on alpine rock and scrambling, and I am an expert skier with experience in the\nbackcountry, but this was my first ski-mountaineering expedition. Scott had more\nexperience on this type of terrain than me, but ultimately our lack of experience\njudging the snowpack proved costly, especially on a route where the descent is on a\ndifferent aspect than the approach.\n    The skiing was very much within our abilities, and we did make some good deci-\nsions that day, principally to wear helmets\u2014in my case, a stout, heavy ski helmet.\n The very lightweight climbing helmet that I had debated bringing probably would\nnot have protected me from the repeated blows to the head I received. We carried\nfull avalanche gear, and I believe the fully assembled shovel in my large backpack\nsaved me from a more severe back injury. We also got an early start, leaving plenty\nof daylight for the eventual rescue. Although I ended up having perfect cell service\nfrom the mountain, I also had a Garmin inReach Mini that I could have used to call\nfor help. (Source: Alec Orenstein.)",

This 45-foot, slightly overhanging sport\nroute is located on Haus Rock near Keystone, Colorado. Faulhaber, a climber with 12\nyears of experience, set up his system using a single strand of 9.5mm dynamic rope.\nHe fixed the rope and descended using a Petzl Grigri, clipping the rope into one bolt\nnear the top as a directional on the overhanging route.\n     For a self-belay, he switched to a Petzl Shunt attached to his harness\u2019 belay loop with\na locking, anti-cross-loading carabiner. As he climbed, Faulhaber tied overhand stop-\nper knots as backups. The rope was weighted at the base by water bottles and shoes\nto allow the Shunt to run smoothly up the rope. He worked the moves for most of the\nmorning, falling about 30 times without incident. In a Mountain Project post, Faulhaber\nwrote, \u201cI try the section, fall on the Shunt, brush, lower, try again, repeat.\u201d He linked the\nmoves and decided to try the crux sequence again. This ten-foot section of V8 crimping\nrequired twisting and high-stepping about 30 feet off the ground.

Faulhaber sustained multiple broken\nbones, including L1 and L2 vertebrae, both heels, right elbow, pelvis, sacrum, and ribs.\n\nANALYSIS\nFirst and foremost, do not use the Petzl Shunt for solo top-roping. The Shunt is\ndesigned to use below a rappel device as a back-up, replacing a friction hitch like\nthe prusik. [There was a very similar incident in West Virginia this year. See page 91.]\n    Faulhaber\u2019s Shunt and locking carabiner were still properly attached to his belay\nloop. The rope and stopper knots were intact. His last stopper knot was about six feet\nbelow where he fell. But the Shunt had somehow cleanly detached from the rope.\n    Faulhaber had researched different devices and solo techniques. He chose the\nShunt after seeing it recommended on a blog/video by a professional climber. Though\nclimbers have used the Shunt for solo top-roping since the 1980s, it was generally\nunderstood that it should only be used where the rope hangs straight down on verti-\ncal or less than vertical terrain. The Petzl website states that the Shunt is not recom-\nmended for self-belay for many reasons, including but not limited to the risk of the\ndevice\u2019s cam jamming in an overhanging or traversing situation.\n    Though Petzl has discouraged self-belay use since 2012, Faulhaber purchased\na Shunt that featured a pre-2012 technical notice. The attached diagram showed a\nclimber ascending a fixed line in vertical terrain with the Shunt. It also featured a\ndiagram discouraging ascending a rope in overhanging terrain. Today, some retail\nwebsites that sell climbing gear still feature this older technical notice, and may even\nstill recommend the Shunt for ascending.\n    The best Faulhaber can surmise is that the gymnastic twisting and high-stepping\npositions on the overhanging crux contributed to the accident. The device showed\nminimal deformation upon later inspection.\n    The most plausible theory is that the device turned sideways just below Faulha-\nber\u2019s waist as he high-stepped. There may have been enough friction in the system\nto create slack above the device, catching the rope in a sideways position as he fell.\nInstead of the Shunt\u2019s camming unit engaging, the rope may have caught in the small\n channel between the camming unit and the outer edge of the device\u2019s frame. This\nmight have created large and unparallel forces that shock-loaded the device, allow-\ning it to flex, and thus releasing the rope.\n    The best illustration of this phenomenon, referred to as the \u201cScorpion Catch\u201d\n(because the twisted rope looks like a scorpion\u2019s tail), can be found on climbing guide\nYann Camus\u2019 YouTube page or with the online version of this report. Again, Petzl\nclearly states that the Shunt is designed to be used only as a rappel backup and not\nfor top-rope soloing.

        "Details_Factors": "Belay Anchor Failure\nEldorado Canyon State Park, Wind Tower\nOn August 26, two climbers fell over 100 feet from Wind Ridge (4 pitches, 5.7). Climber\n1 was in his 20s and survived with severe injuries. Climber 2 was in his 30s. He\nsustained fatal injuries.\n   The pair had climbed the first pitch of Tigger (5.6), followed by the second pitch\nof Wind Ridge. The second-pitch belay occupies a large ledge and offers a walk-off\ndescent. The team opted for two more pitches (the last \u201cpitch\u201d being an easy traverse\nto a two-bolt rappel station). In a Climbing magazine accident report, Climber 1\nrecalled using a cordelette to girth-hitch a horn in the alcove for a belay.\n   Climber 1 began leading the third pitch, which starts with awkward and strenu-\nous moves into a large hueco. He exited the hueco and moved up, at which point he\ngave his belayer a warning and fell.\n   An eyewitness, Aubrey Runyon, was climbing below. She heard Climber 1 shout\n\u201cFalling!\u201d before plummeting and yanking the belayer off the ledge.

By then, Runyon had fixed ropes for the responders to facilitate a\nquicker rescue.\n\nANALYSIS\nEldorado Canyon is notorious for its heady climbing style and demanding terrain.\nAdventure often extends into the realm of gear placements and, in this case, belay\nanchors. The second-pitch belay of Wind Ridge offers few obvious anchor options to\nthe uninitiated. Though there are multiple possibilities, the best is a large block requir-\ning a very long cordelette or using a climbing rope as a tie-off. Both these practices,\nwhile standard on routes of similar grade/length, are often not used by neophytes or\nthose transitioning into trad from other disciplines. The block also positions the belayer\nin an inconvenient spot [see photo above]. The very size of the ledge can lull climbers\ninto a false sense of security. The last point might explain this tragedy.\n    Runyon found no gear clipped to the rope between Climber 1 and Climber 2, indi-\ncating there may have been no intermediate protection between the two climbers at\nthe moment of the fall. Later, SAR found no evidence of an anchor at the belay ledge.\nPerhaps the pair were unanchored. Perhaps their gear came unclipped or broke, as\ncan happen in severe incidents. What is certain is their anchor, assuming they had\none, was insufficient.\n    This exact spot was the site of an eerily similar accident several months prior [see\nreport below]. One takeaway from this tragedy is that classic Eldorado climbs may\nask more from the novice climber than the \u201ceasy\u201d grade and endless queues at the\nbase might indicate.

According to the victim\u2019s personal Mountain Project page, he began free\nsoloing regularly several months before his accident. Most of the routes he had\nclimbed unroped were ones which he had previously redpointed. Even so, the routes\nwere only a few grades below those which he was typically leading.

The climbers, who were from Manitou Springs and Fort\nCollins, had started climbing at 10 a.m. and neared the top at dusk.

        "Details_Factors": "\nDenver\nOn July 23, I broke my foot and ankle in two places while belaying another climber.\nI was working with a nonprofit at a Denver multisport event involving disabled\nveterans. I set up their mobile climbing wall to use with a gentleman who had had\na stroke the year before. He had hemiplegia (a form of paralysis that\u2019s a common\nafter-effect of a stroke) resulting in severe weakness on the right side. For climbers\nsuch as himself, I set up a top-rope with a static rope so I can provide a power belay,\nwithout dynamic stretch.\n    The man was able to lift and grip a bit with his right hand. He was much bigger\nthan me, and when asked he claimed to weigh 245 pounds. I weigh 145, so I was not\nconcerned about the difference. He climbed to about two feet from the top (22 feet\ntotal) when he slipped and fell back hard. I was standing three feet from the center line\nto keep the rope off his back. When he fully weighted the rope, I slid over the gravel\nand was lifted like I\u2019d held a leader fall. I quickly put my foot up to stop myself on the\nwall. The force fractured my heel and navicular bone. My doctor believes I was slightly\noff center and my foot hit at a weird angle. Had I hit flat, it would have been fine.\n    I didn\u2019t want the man to know he had injured me, so I lowered him and sat down.\nHe wanted to climb again, so I put him on an auto-belay. Once he was finished, I told\na staff member my foot was broken. I hopped away, got a ride to my car, and drove\nto the ER in Fort Collins.\n\nANALYSIS\nLater I looked at the man\u2019s online registration form, and he had listed his weight as\n320 pounds. If I had known that he weighed more than twice as much as me, I would\nhave anchored myself to the base before belaying and maybe used an Edelrid Ohm\nto reduce the impact force of any fall. I also might have kept my shoulder against the\nwall so that the force was up, not up and in.\n    But the main takeaway is, if the climber is much bigger than you, anchor your-\nself before belaying, even for a top-rope. Protect yourself at all costs. (Source: Craig\nDeMartino, age 56.)\n    Editor\u2019s Note: DeMartino\u2019s lower right leg was amputated after a climbing accident\nalmost 20 years ago.

The moder-\nate grades, easy access, and sun-drenched aspect make this particular cliff a busy\nyear-round destination. However, this is not a gym, and natural rockfall should be\nexpected at any crag in a mountainous or canyon environment. (This is especially\ntrue after heavy rain or snow or during wind storms, all of which can dislodge rocks.)\nAdopting an alpinist\u2019s sense of mountain awareness can help prevent such accidents.\nWatch and listen for rockfall, try to choose protected belay areas, and wear helmets\nwhile climbing, belaying, or waiting your turn to climb.

All three were\nveteran climbers, with collective experience exceeding 100 years, and all had been\naccident-free until the day of this incident.\n    Peter led the 5.8 pitch and was lowered from an anchor 50 feet to the ground.\nVivien clipped into the middle of the rope with a \u201cdouble figure 8\u201d knot on her locking\nbelay carabiner, and ascended the route to the belay chains. Another party arrived\nat the base of the climb, intending to climb the same route. Peter then asked Vivien\nto rig the single anchor to allow both parties to use the anchor. Vivien yelled, \u201cTake.\u201d\nPeter attempted to take up slack and observed Vivien freefalling to the ground.\n    Vivien struck the ground only seven feet away from Peter. The surface was rela-\ntively flat sand and grass. Vivien was conscious and breathing, but confused. Peter was\na physician and was able to determine she had a pelvis and hip fracture and may have\nsustained internal injuries. Peter immobilized her neck and pelvis, as best he could,\nand yelled for help. There was no cell phone service at this location. Two climbers on\nthe ground were sent to notify the National Park Service headquarters of the accident.\n    Two other climbers (rangers Austin Palmieri and Nate Ament from Arches National\nPark) were climbing an adjacent route. They had a Garmin inReach and were able to\nsend a distress signal. The rangers relayed that a medical helicopter evacuation was\nurgently required, and that a suitable landing zone was available only 200 yards away.\nThe helicopter arrived within 20 minutes, and Vivien was transported to Portneuf\nMedical Center in Pocatello, Idaho.\n    Vivien suffered a cardiac arrest just after arrival at the hospital and miraculously\nsurvived a complex resuscitation, which involved transfusions greater than three times\nher blood volume, and two trips to the operating room. At the time this report was writ-\nten, four months after the accident, Vivien was neurologically intact, walking, swimming,\nand continued to be committed to her rehabilitation. She had no recall of the accident.\n\nANALYSIS\nThis accident occurred through failure of the climber to retie her knot after recon-\nfiguring her anchor. Vivien was not attached to the climbing rope when she fell.\nHuman error played a role, with contributing factors including: 1) Vivien had tied\ninto the middle of the rope, not her usual procedure; 2) Another party arrived, wish-\ning to ascend the same climb, creating some feeling of time pressure; 3) Peter asked\nVivien to rig the anchor such that two parties could use it, and believes his request\nwas distracting; 4) Vivien untied from the middle of the rope while rigging the anchor\nand failed to tie back in; 5) Vivien called \u201ctake,\u201d but it\u2019s believed she did not wait for\nthe pull of the rope or weight-test the system. Given the extent of her injuries, Vivien\nwas fortunate that another party nearby was able to contact EMS with their satellite\ncommunication device, which likely saved her life.

I (male, 22) racked up and\nchecked Mountain Project for info on the route.\n    I noticed a giant loose chockstone at the start that seemed like it might be neces-\nsary to pull on to get established in the crack. I opted for a start on the face to the left\nto avoid the chockstone. The move was extremely committing (almost like pulling a\nroof with a mantel onto the face). I made one or two moves and found myself stuck.\nI could not traverse right into the crack, as it would involve using the awful chock-\nstone, and I couldn\u2019t move up because the rock was featureless. At this point, I was\nabout 10 feet off the ground with no gear placed. I began to downclimb and almost\nslipped. I decided the only option was to jump, so my friends cleared the landing and\nspotted me for the fall.\n    I committed to the jump and landed perfectly flat-footed on my left foot. Due\nto having so much gear on my harness and landing with all the weight on one\nfoot, I immediately felt an awful shooting pain in my entire foot. I fell over and lay\non my back to see if the pain would dissipate. I removed my climbing shoes and\nother gear and waited. About 30 minutes passed, and the foot was now swelling\nquickly. I couldn\u2019t put any weight on it, so the only option was to carry me out.\nMy friend, and coworker at the time, Diego, picked me up and carried me like a\nbackpack about 80 percent of the Long Wall access trail. I was able to crab walk\non the steeper sections.\n    I found out about a week later that I had a Lisfranc fracture (the space between the\nbig and second toe) in my left foot. I couldn\u2019t walk for three months, and I still have\nlingering pain despite months of PT. All of this was because I did the wrong start to\na 5.7, and with it being a trad route, I had no way to \u201ctake.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\nI learned from the accident to always check and double-check the correct start of\na route if unsure (especially true for unprotected trad). Later, I discovered from a\ncomment on Mountain Project that another climber had fallen six feet to the ground\nwhile attempting the same start to avoid the chockstone. They also commented that\nthe rest of the party used the chockstone without an issue. (Source: Adam Gallimore.)\n    Editor\u2019s Note: According to another climber at the crag that day, the chockstone\nwas stable and used by other parties. The climber may have been able to reach a stance\nto assess the stone before making his decision. The takeaway is, it\u2019s better to avoid the\nroute altogether than resort to an alternative start that\u2019s proven to cause\u2014in this case\nat least\u2014lasting injury.",

Logan was using the cable car (a.k.a. tram) method to retrieve his draws,\nstaying clipped to the belayer\u2019s side of the rope, as is common when cleaning over-\nhanging routes. The first draw on the route was a permadraw so the climber didn\u2019t\nneed to clean it. After he finished cleaning his draws from the route, Zhang continued\nlowering with the belayer\u2019s rope still running through the first draw. Before reach-\ning the ground, he removed the tram draw from the belayer\u2019s rope and fell, hitting a\nboulder below the climb. He suffered a minor head laceration.\n\nANALYSIS\nIt is common for climbers to use the cable car or tram method to clean their draws\noff steep routes. It is important to understand the system and the consequences\nof adjustments. This incident could have been avoided by keeping the tram draw\nconnected until the climber had reached the ground. Removing the tram draw when\nthe climber is far from an overhanging wall instantly introduces slack into the system\nand the climber will drop. Also, remember to knot the end of the rope to close the\nsystem; the tram method uses more rope than standard lowering.\n     Alternatively, Logan could have removed the tram draw when he cleaned the\nquickdraw at the second bolt and taken the swing from this location, if it was safe to\ndo so. This situation is not uncommon. Many climbers choose to leave their own draw\non the first bolt for safety or efficiency when cleaning overhanging routes.

        "Details_Factors": "\nMinnesota, Taylors Falls\nOn March 25, Climber 1 (31) and Climber 2 (23) were involved in a rock climbing\naccident at Interstate State Park in Taylors Falls, Minnesota. The accident occurred\nwhile rappelling, with both falling from near the top of the cliff. Climber 2 was killed\nin the accident, and Climber 1 was seriously injured.\n    Climber 1 had over a decade of climbing experience, including trad, sport, and\nalpine climbing, from Minnesota to Alaska. He had worked as an outdoor trip leader\nfor the University of Minnesota, graduating with a degree in recreation administra-\ntion and a minor in outdoor recreation and education.\n     Climber 2 had climbed indoors\nextensively, with some experi-\nence bouldering and sport climb-\ning outdoors. He had been planning\na road trip for the upcoming climb-\ning season with his girlfriend. Accord-\ning to Climber 1, Climber 2 wanted to\nexpand his skills in preparation for that\ntrip. March 25 was intended to be the\nfirst in a series of mentoring outings.\n    On the way to the crag, the pair\ndiscussed goals for the day. Climber\n2 wanted to focus on anchors and get\nintroduced to trad gear. Upon arrival,\nthe team spent 30 minutes discuss-\ning types of protection (nuts, hexes,\nand cams), along with the SERENE\nacronym for anchor building. They\nthen walked to an adjacent crag and\nfurther discussed anchors at the base.\nAfter about an hour, they walked to\nthe top of the cliff and built an anchor\ntogether to top-rope a popular route\ncalled The Bulge.                         This pillar is a solid block about five feet high and\n    After lunch, they agreed on mini- a foot wide. It\u2019s estimated to weigh at least a ton.\npitching (breaking a single established Climber 1: \u201cThe block appears to extend into the\nrope length into two short pitches) ground both at the bottom and back. In reality, it is\n                                          completely separated and can be moved back and\nan easy route and then finish the day\n                                          forth over an inch with only moderate effort.\u201d The\nby building an anchor and rappelling. failed cam placements are marked. Climber 1\nThey chose the nearby Sonny and\nJuanita (5.5, trad). The route is about 45 feet tall, with a large ledge 35 feet up.\n    Climber 1 had climbed Sonny and Juanita many times and led two short pitches\nto the top without incident. There, he built an anchor comprised of three small cams\nplaced in a vertical crack at the back of a ledge. He tied all the pieces together with a\ncordelette and tied in direct. He then belayed Climber 2 to the top, where the latter\ntied in directly to the anchor and the pair set up the rappel. Climber 2 had limited\nrappel experience and wanted to gain more.\n    After safety checks, Climber 2 unclipped from the anchor and rappelled over the\nlip. Still connected to the anchor, Climber 1 leaned over the edge to watch his part-\nner rappel. When Climber 2 was 10 feet below the lip, Climber 1 heard a loud cracking\nnoise. He turned his head quickly enough to see the anchor gear snapping out of the\ncrack. He was then pulled off of the ledge by his falling partner\u2019s weight.\n    He recalls, \u201cI vaguely remember hitting the large ledge ten feet beneath me with\nthe left side of my body before falling the rest of the way to the ground. I was knocked\nunconscious by the impact, landing just a few feet from where I tied in to do my very\nfirst climb nearly ten years before.\u201d\n    Many bystanders in this popular area responded, as Climber 1 fell in and out of\nconsciousness. An ambulance arrived and he was driven to the hospital and then\nflown to a regional medical center. X-rays and CT scans revealed no major broken\nbones or internal injuries. He suffered two sprained ankles, a broken left foot, a\nseverely dislocated left ring finger, abrasions, and a concussion. Climber 2 unfortu-\nnately died from the injuries suffered in the fall.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe rappel anchor was built with three cams in a single crack in the blocky basalt\natop the cliff. The combined weight of Climber 2 rappelling and Climber 1 leaning\noff his tether to look over the edge was apparently enough to lever open the crack\nand cause the cams to fail.\n     Climber 1 recalled, \u201cI have built over 1,000 anchors in rock, ice, and snow in my\nclimbing career. I have never had a piece of protection, let alone a whole anchor, fail.\nI do remember testing the rock and it not moving, but regardless of how well I tested\nit, there was simply no reason to build the anchor in a single crack. There were other\nrock features in the area I could have used, along with at least one significant tree I\ncould have included in the anchor.\u201d\n     He concluded, \u201cBuilding an anchor with three pieces of protection does not neces-\nsarily mean that anchor is redundant. A redundant anchor should also use redundant\nfeatures. This ensures that if one of the rock features fails, the other pieces remain intact.\u201d\n     Using multiple features to build an anchor is particularly important in an area\nlike Taylors Falls, which is susceptible to severe freeze/thaw cycles and is known to\nhave fractured rock. The top of the cliff is composed of exposed and often shattered\nbasalt. Small rocks are routinely released from the cliff tops and faces, and at times\nentire rock formations have failed.

The route follows a crack\nin a dihedral. The climber fell while making a dynamic move on the face of the over-\nhanging right wall. He took a long freefall that was arrested abruptly, hitting the left\n(vertical) face hard and resulting in a severe open fracture of the left tibia and fibula.\nThe placed gear held.\n    The climber had been working this route for a couple of weeks. He took a simi-\nlar fall while making the same move the day before with a different belayer. The fall\nthat resulted in the injury was described as significantly longer than the previous\nfall and finished with an abrupt pendulum into the wall. The climber also felt like he\ncame off the wall angled to the left. Both the climber and belayer have many years\nof experience.\n\nANALYSIS\nClimber positioning during the fall likely contributed to the injury. It also appears the\nbelayer may have had more slack in the system than appropriate and did not \u201cmove\ninto\u201d the fall enough when the rope tightened (to soften the arrest). With very steep\nclimbs, common in the Southeast, some belayers can get in the habit of leaving out\nexcessive slack, since a falling climber is unlikely to impact the wall with enough force\nto cause injury. While most of the climbing on Charlie is along the steeper right side\nof the dihedral, the belayer needs to consider that the climber may swing into the\nvertical left face during a fall and should soften the arrest appropriately.\n    It is a common misconception that extra slack equates to a soft catch. The slack\nlengthens a fall, but it is the belayer\u2019s movement into the fall as the rope tightens\nthat softens the arrest.

Sievers later\nsaid, \u201cIn hindsight I\u2019m not convinced I made the right choice. An airlift would have\nlikely been faster.\u201d\n    Sievers made three rappels down the lower tier using a kleimheist backup on the\nropes. He was in pain but unaware that his back was broken. Once on the ground,\nthe pair worked their way down the trail. That morning, they had done the 1.5 mile\napproach hike via the Lava Lake trailhead. Now, with the highway just on the other\nside of the river, and given his condition, Sievers believed his best option was to catch\na ride across the Gallatin River from one of the many active commercial raft outfits.\nSievers suggested Meshew descend ahead of him, take his motorcycle home, and\nreturn with his truck to collect Sievers. Meshew agreed and departed. Using a dry\nbranch as a crutch, Sievers descended a rugged 400 feet to the climbers\u2019 trail and the\nGallatin River. Eventually, a rafter ferried him to the other side of the river. Meshew\narrived with the truck. Seven hours after the accident, Sievers was in a Bozeman ER.\u00a0\u00a0\n    Sievers was diagnosed with a broken T-11 vertebra, broken bones in his right ankle,\na broken tibia base, and a possible head injury (TBI). In June 2022, Sievers wrote, \u201cI\u2019m\nlooking at a second spinal surgery, and the neurosurgeon said I should give up climb-\ning and skiing since my lumbar group has no discs left and is now bone on bone.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\nSerious falls often occur on \u201ceasy\u201d terrain. It can happen to anyone at any time. With\ndecades of climbing in all genres, Sievers was extremely experienced. He notes with\nsome irony that, \u201cAfter almost 40 years of climbing, some of it on very sketchy mixed\nalpine routes, this was my first serious fall\u2014on a [expletive deleted] bolted 5.7 pitch.\u201d\n     In accidents like this, rock quality frequently comes into play. On Mountain Project,\nthe first pitch of Silver Foxes is called \u201cone of the best moderates in the canyon with\namazing face climbing.\u201d Yet as this accident shows, rock quality can never be taken for\ngranted, especially if you leave the most traveled line on a route, as Sievers did.\n     Finally, Meshew was belaying with a Black Diamond ATC-Guide. While such a\ndevice is versatile and adequate, had he been using an assisted-braking device, such\nas a Grigri, he might have been able to arrest Sievers\u2019 fall sooner while dodging the\nfalling rocks. This might have \u201c\u2026saved me maybe 50 percent of the fall distance,\u201d wrote\nSievers. \u201cI remember him showing me his hand\u2014the rope zipping through burned a\nline in his palm.\u201d (Sources: Greg Sievers, Mountain Project.)",

They had not previously climbed together. They planned to climb The Thrill\nis Gone, a classic M4 chimney on the popular and paradoxically named Unnamed\nWall. W had been rock climbing for almost five years and ice climbing for three. T\nwas very experienced on rock and had three years of ice climbing.\n    At the crag, T led Thrill and cleaned the route. W then re-led Thrill. As he climbed,\n he noticed a bolted mixed route to the left\nand decided to attempt that route next. The\nguidebook identified it as Sharp Dressed\nMan (M6 R). Though often ice-covered, the\nroute had ice only a third of the way down.\nW concluded the R rating was due to the\nbolts being iced over in most seasons.

Instead, he tape, and a borrowed ski strap.\nplaced his left tool on a precarious sloping\nedge and locked off. The clip was reachy, but he could not find other obvious holds.\nAs W fumbled for a quickdraw his tool popped. He fell off the wall with a scream.\nW plummeted eight feet before striking a rocky ledge with his left foot. His crampon\nsnagged on the rock and the foot caved inward. He fell the remaining distance, land-\ning on his right foot in a soft patch of snow before rolling onto his tailbone and back.\n    His partner and some friends rushed over. W took off his left crampon without\nremoving the boot. The rescuers made a makeshift splint with ice tools, duct tape,\nand a borrowed ski strap. With assistance from the other climbers and some butt\nscooting, W made it back to T\u2019s truck. The ER doctor, himself an ice climber, deter-\nmined that W had broken bones in his ankle but most likely wouldn\u2019t need surgery.\n ANALYSIS\nWhen one is young and ambitious, it\u2019s not uncommon to push oneself hard, but\npushing the limits on ice and mixed terrain can get out of control much faster than\nin other disciplines. In retrospect, W says, \u201cThe most striking error in the decision-\nmaking was my insistence on leading a difficult route with insufficient experience.\nUntil this season I had almost exclusively climbed water ice. Though I managed a\ncouple D6/7 top-ropes and a handful of thin ice leads earlier this year, I had never\nled a proper dry-tool route. Sharp Dressed Man was clearly outside my skill level,\nbut I recall thinking I could easily climb it.\n    \u201cI subconsciously believed that, because I hadn\u2019t fallen before, I wouldn\u2019t fall this\ntime. In spite of several recent accidents in the community, I seemed to think I was\nsomehow different and invulnerable. Equally influential was my ego and desire to be\nrespected by the people around me\u2014foremost my partner T. His wealth of experience,\ncombined with the fact that we\u2019d never climbed together before, made me eager to\nleave a good impression.\u201d [Editor\u2019s Note: Sharp Dressed Man was first climbed by Alex\nLowe and Jack Tackle in 1984. Those who are aware of their climbing record treat their\nroutes with great deference.]\n    W continued: \u201cI incorrectly extrapolated that because the first few feet of boul-\ndering felt easy, the remaining 60-plus feet would be the same. Furthermore, my\nconsultation of the guidebook consisted of a quick scan and a glance at the photos.\nHad I actually taken the time to read the passage, I would have discovered [this\nroute] was a popular top-rope and rarely iced over, earning its R rating from a run-\nout above a final manky piton.\n    \u201cThe final flaw in my decision-making was my refusal to establish a safety net. As\na good friend of mine said, I was \u2018free soloing until the first bolt.\u2019 Although I consid-\nered setting up a top-rope from the chains of Thrill, one of the first things to pass\nthrough my head was a concern for how I would be perceived. I also hadn\u2019t realized\nthat stick-clipping was the preferred method to clip the first bolt.\n    \u201cReflecting on the accident, I see how much worse it could have been. I am so\ngrateful for the medical training of my rescuers and their calm and efficient response.\u201d\n(Source: W.)",

Miriam led the climb and reached the\nanchors, where she began the task of cleaning the gear in preparation for lowering.\n   This was the first time Miriam had attempted to complete this transition, and\nLawrence stated that he had coached her on the ground on how to clean an anchor\nsafely. Lawrence noted that Miriam spent more time at the top anchors than a more\nexperienced climber would have. She pulled up on the rope multiple times to take\nher weight off the rope or her personal anchor system (PAS). When she sat back as if\nready to lower, she fell approximately 90 feet to the ground, her rope falling with her.\n   She received multiple fractures and other injuries in the fall. First responders stated\nshe was breathing but not responsive. Her helmet was removed to check her pulse,\nand she was left in the position where she landed until she stopped breathing. At this\npoint she was repositioned and CPR was started. Once paramedics arrived, they deter-\nmined there was no heart activity and stopped CPR.

First,\nthere should be clear communication between climber and belayer as to what\u2019s going\nto happen at the anchor before the climber leaves the ground. Second, new climbers\ncan practice threading and cleaning a mock anchor on the ground before doing it at\nthe top of a route. Once the climber is at the anchor, if communication is clear, the\nexperienced belayer should verbally talk the climber through the steps of cleaning\nthe anchor, or the climber can verbalize each step to the belayer for confirmation.\nAnd finally, once threaded through the anchor, the climber should make sure they\nare still on belay before committing to the rope.

Both climbers reached the\ntop of the 110-foot first pitch. Once the anchor and belay were established, Lin took\nthe lead. The 90-foot second pitch moves right off the belay and follows a quartz\ndike to a bolted belay.\n    Lin described what happened next: \u201cI became unintentionally off route and\u2026tried\nto make my way back to the intended route, but the protection below was suspect.\nI got to a point where there was not very good protection about two feet below the\ndike. Here, I had placed a Black Diamond C4 cam (0.75) about knee height, but I knew\nit was not an ideal placement as I had only three lobes engaged. I stalled and thought\nthrough what I was going to do and decided to reach for the next hold. Unfortunately,\nI fell. The BD .75 popped and I continued to fall. As momentum continued to carry\nme, the next piece, a number 3 C4, came out. [The next piece], a nut I placed, ended\nup catching my fall.\u201d\n    Lin fell approximately 100 feet. During his fall, he tumbled a couple of times and\nin the process struck his head, damaging his helmet. \u201cCatherine was able to arrest\nmy fall and immediately called my name, but I was unable to respond. After approxi-\nmately five minutes of contemplating our situation, she decided I needed medical\nattention after noticing blood coming from a lacerated ear. Thankfully, she had cell\nservice and made the call to search and rescue. Because she knew our exact location,\nrescue personnel were able to reach us in approximately 60 minutes.\u201d\n    One of the first to arrive on the scene was Karsten Delap, a local guide and Tran-\nsylvania County Rescue Squad member. He was able to climb to Lin and found him\nconscious. He secured and stabilized Lin and did a primary survey. During the survey,\nDelap noted a lacerated left ear, bloody nose, and a possible head injury. Delap was\nable to tandem-rappel with Lin to the ground. Transylvania Rescue Squad members\nwere notified and requested the Mountain Area Medical Airlift helicopter (MAMA)\nfor transport to Mission Memorial Hospital in Asheville.\n    Once rescuers arrived to aid Lin, Delap ascended to Chee and tandem-rappelled\nwith her to the ground, where she was treated for mild hypothermia.\n Looking Glass Rock. The unusual horizontal wrinkles called \u201ceyebrows\u201d create unique climbing\nand protection placements. The Nose is on the left side of the cliff (center of photo). Karsten Delap\n\nANALYSIS\nLin commented:\n(1) Guidebook: I own two North Carolina guidebooks and researched the route, and\n    truly thought I was going the intended way. Unfortunately, once I realized I was\n    off route, it became incredibly difficult to get back on track.\n(2) Weather: The day that we went climbing, there was still some snow on the ground\n    from snowfall earlier in the week. That day in particular was also relatively cold\n    (mid-40s F), and it is reasonable to think that in the darker parts of the wall with\n    no sunlight that it was slicker than normal.\u00a0\u00a0\n(3) Gear Placement: This goes along with the first item: Because I was a little off route,\n    the gear placement was less than ideal, with suspect rock.

He became stranded after climbing into\nan area with overhanging rocks above, having passed through terrain he was unable\nor unwilling to downclimb.\n    Fortunately, the climber was able to access his cell phone and call 911, despite poor\ncellular reception in the area. The call was made at 8:51 a.m. For several reasons, it\ntook Deschutes County Sheriff\u2019s Office Search and Rescue about 6.5 hours to make\nhands-on contact with the soloist, largely due to the great difficulty in locating his\nposition on the mountain. Despite three flights, visual confirmation via helicop-\nter of his exact location was unsuccessful. Similarly, verbal contact once three SAR\nmembers were on scene was difficult due to the mountain\u2019s topography and weather.\nSince the climber had carried no rope or protection, he could not anchor himself\nduring this extended search.\n    The climber eventually was located when three volunteer rescuers were dropped\noff at the South Sister summit and then downclimbed about 600 feet and traversed\n                                                        about 500 feet eastward to be\n                                                       directly above the climber.

The accident took place during a training event at Steelhead Falls. The ground\nand rock were dry, with air temperature estimated to be in the high 70s F.\n   While ascending the rope, the subject\u2019s glove got caught on the exposed teeth of\nan Edelrid Spoc progress-capture pulley being used for ascension, while the climber\nwas attempting to move it upward on the rope. As a result, the teeth of the progress-\ncapture pulley failed to engage the rope and the pulley slid down the rope onto the\nsubject\u2019s lower rope grab [the term for any device or hitch that travels on the rope\nand automatically engages to arrest a fall]. The lower rope grab consisted of a 5mm\naccessory cord configured as a foot loop and attached to the rope with a prusik hitch.\nThis lower rope grab was connected to the subject\u2019s harness by a locking carabiner\nconnected to an older model Metolius Ultimate Daisy Chain girth-hitched to their\nharness belay loop. The pulley collapsed and tended the prusik hitch (prevented the\n prusik from grabbing the rope) as it was weighted, resulting in loss of positive connec-\ntion to the rope. The result was an uncontrolled fall to the ground.\n   The team member sustained only minor injuries, despite the significant mecha-\nnism of injury involved. Injuries were limited to abrasion and mild pain to the pelvis/\nback region. Other CMRU members at the scene performed an in-line traveling haul\nrescue to get the injured member back up to safety at the top of the cliff. [Editor\u2019s\nNote: The use of the Edelirid Spoc above a prusik is not shown in the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.]\n\nANALYSIS\nThe upper rope grab was defeated, fell\ndown onto the lower rope grab (three-\nwrap prusik with 5mm accessory cord),\nand caused it to fail. A CMRU member was\nlater able to re-create the cause of the\naccident using several combinations of\nprogress-capture pulleys of various brands\nover friction hitches. It appears the cause\nof this accident was not directly associ-\nated with any particular brand of gear or\ntype of friction hitch used, but rather the\nconfiguration of a \u201chard\u201d rope grab over a\n\u201csoft\u201d rope grab.\n    A secondary cause of this incident\nwas the climber\u2019s glove getting caught\non the teeth of the upper ascender while\nmanipulating the device, which may have When the climber\u2019s glove caught in the teeth of\nprevented it from fully engaging the rope. the progress-capture pulley, the device slid down\n                                              the rope, causing the prusik hitch below to fail.\nThe ascender was a pulley that was capa-\n                                              The climber fell to the ground, suffering friction\nble of overriding the prusik and break- burns through the glove.

By being only\npartially weighted (with some of the climber\u2019s weight being supported by the foot\non a ledge) the grip of the lower prusik hitch may not have been solidly set and may\nhave been looser around the rope than normal, allowing it to be broken more easily.\n\nOther contributing factors:\n\u2022   Inexperienced climber using newly learned skills with high-angle exposure on\n    rock while ascending a rope\n\u2022   Lack of full familiarity with all components used in the ascending system\n\u2022   Improvised activity, informal environment (prior to start of \u201creal\u201d training agenda)\n\u2022   Expert halo effect possibly obfuscated or minimized the hazards of the activity\n\u2022   Fatigue near the end of the day, after a long drive to training site by the climber\n\n    (Source: Joe McCormick, Corvallis Mountain Rescue Unit.)",

Lunging for a\nloose hold initiated the falls, and the absence of a progress-capture device on the last\nbolt guaranteed a long plunge for Climber A. The team\u2019s choice to use 8.5mm ropes\nwas a measure of their goal of efficiency. In this case it elevated the risk, as the rope\nthat caught the two falling climbers snagged on the rock, tearing the sheath open\nand revealing the rope\u2019s core.\n   Though Mountain Project says this route has \u201cthe commitment of a long wall or\nalpine route and the seriousness of hard, sand-in-your-eye desert routes or adven-\n ture routes in the Black Canyon,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean unnecessary risks are required.\nClimber A says that linking pitches \u201cwasn\u2019t necessary\u2014there was time to stop and\npitch it out.\u201d He also adds, \u201cIt was one of those worst things that could happen in a\nworst-place scenario.\u201d (Sources: Climber A and Mountain Project.)",

At about 1:15 p.m., Boos was unroped and traversing 3rd-class\nterrain below Satan\u2019s Corner (5.8) to reach the start of Half-A-Finger (5.9+). He pulled\non a large block, reported to be the size of a Subaru. The block dislodged, causing\nhim to fall 20 to 30 feet. \u201cAfter he hit the ground, the boulder he had pulled out fell\non top of him before continuing to roll down the mountain,\u201d said Sgt. Melody Cutler\nof Greater Salt Lake\u2019s Unified Police Department. The boulder nearly hit two other\nclimbers further below, though they escaped unscathed.\n    Boos\u2019 climbing partner was belaying another climber nearby and was able to quickly\nreach him, establish him in a stable position, and call emergency services. Boos was\nnot breathing, and his partner began CPR. Other climbers set up fixed lines for EMS\nto access the scene quickly and safely. When EMS arrived shortly afterward, Boos had\nnot been breathing unassisted for over 20 minutes and was pronounced dead.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nANALYSIS\nBoos was very experienced and a well-known member of the Salt Lake climbing\nand skiing community.

Best practices include wearing a helmet, testing holds, and using a rope\nand gear for protection when practical. [For more information, see Safer 4th Class, by\nTico Gangulee, ANAC 2018.] Still, rapid unroped movement on 3rd-class terrain is\noften standard practice.

        "Details_Factors": "Dropped Rope\nCastle Valley, Castleton Tower\nOn February 6, Clarissa Fortier (29) and Ariel* (32) climbed the Kor-Ingalls Route (4\npitches, 5.9+) on Castleton Tower. Ariel was an Israeli living in the United States, and\nFortier was an American with six years of climbing experience throughout Colorado\nand southeastern Utah. Fortier had climbed Kor-Ingalls twice previously.\n     The morning forecast was good for the south-facing Kor-Ingalls: highs in the\n40s F, sunny, and no wind advisory, according to Fortier. The team discussed rappel\noptions and decided on a single 70-meter rope to descend the north face rappel\nroute. On pitch two, they considered bailing due to cold and high winds. They chose\nto continue, as the climbing was well within their abilities and they had sufficient\nclothing. They summited at 2:30 p.m. in high winds and were eager to descend. Ariel\ngot to the rappel station and began untangling the rope.\n     At that point, the pair had a miscommunication. Fortier, having experienced stuck\nrappel ropes on other desert routes, suggested saddlebagging the ropes due to the\nhigh winds. Ariel, eager to descend, proceeded to set up the rappel and threw one\nside of the rope down before locating the middle mark. This particular rappel station\nhad larger than typical rap rings. After failing to locate the middle mark, Ariel took the\nother end\u2013shorter in length than the side that had already been tossed\u2013and released\nit. At that point the longer end was picked up by the wind and sucked through the\nanchor. The climbers had tied knots in both ends of the rope, but the stopper knot\nwas pulled through the large rappel rings. The two climbers found themselves rope-\nless on top of the 400-foot tower.\n     Fortier recounts, \u201cWe had a phone and an LTE signal, so we called a friend in\nMoab.\u201d After waiting in vain for a party they\u2019d seen below and realizing their friends\nwould not reach the base until dark, Fortier was encouraged by friends to call Grand\nCounty police around 3:30 p.m.\n     With the wind gusting over 50 mph, a helicopter circled the tower, eventually\nlanding on the summit around 5 p.m. to drop two rescuers. The two rescuers waited\natop Castleton while the climbers were helicoptered to a spot about a mile from the\nCastleton parking lot. They were driven to the Castleton trailhead and then hiked\nback up to the base of the tower in their socks, as their approach shoes, climbing\npacks, and car keys were all at the base of the tower.\n     [*Not the climber\u2019s real name.]\n\n ANALYSIS\nFortier says, \u201cThere are quite a few\nlessons to take away from this event.\nThe greatest one: We should have\nsecured a part of the rope to the\nanchor or to ourselves, because it\nis possible to drop the rope at the\nanchor station, especially in the high\nwinds. She adds, \u201cAnother aspect\nof this event is that Ariel and I did\nnot have clear communication, and\nI allowed the eagerness of getting\noff the tower to take precedent over\nmy desire to rap using saddlebags.\nThis event was a textbook example\nof how rushing can lead to situa-\ntions that are unsafe.

        "Details_Factors": "Inadequate Protection\nIndian Creek, Cliffs of Insanity\nOn the afternoon of October 3, I (Ryan McAvoy, age 24) fell about 50 feet from a route\ncalled Vinciny (5.10). The route is 60 feet tall.\n    It was our second day in the Creek, and I was climbing with a mix of old and new\nfriends. I agreed to lead Vinciny. It starts out fingers, turns to hands, then gains a\nledge before a final flake to the anchors. My phone was dead and I\u2019m not sure if we\nhad a guidebook, but I talked with a new friend, Peggy, who had climbed the route\nbefore. I brought the gear I thought I would need.\n    I am relatively new to leading trad climbs. However, in the months leading up\nto climbing Vinciny, I had been leading multi-pitch routes in Big and Little Cotton-\nwood canyons. I had just returned from a trip to Yosemite. I was feeling good about\nmy abilities.\n    The first 45 feet was a little spicy and fun. I had placed a couple of finger-size\ncams in the first part. I then placed a number 2 and then a bomber number 3 Cama-\nlot before climbing onto a ledge. There was a flake to my left and a small crack to the\nright that went straight to the anchors, 15 feet above. I wanted to place something in\nthe flake, but I hadn\u2019t brought any .75s. Peggy asked if I wanted to pull up some cams\nof that size, but I declined and ended up placing a purple Metolius TCU in the small\ncrack. I laybacked up the flake, smearing my feet on a shallow left facing corner. It\n wasn\u2019t very secure, but I made good progress, running it out because I didn\u2019t have\ngear that would fit and placing would have been difficult.\n    I got to the bolt anchor but couldn\u2019t quite reach it due to awkward feet. I unclipped\nmy personal anchor system so it would be easier to clip the anchor. I decided to reach\nthe chains, grab them, and then clip myself in. As I was reaching for the chains, I fell.\n    On the way down, my right ankle hit the ledge. I flipped upside down for the rest\nof the fall. The purple TCU pulled, and luckily the bomber number 3 caught me. I was\nnot far from the ground when I came to a stop. Peggy lowered me, and two others\nimmediately came to see if I was alright. I believe the first thing I said was, \u201cI think\nI\u2019m okay.\u201d However, I realized my right ankle was not okay.\n    After immobilizing my ankle using Chaco sandals, jackets, and tape, I took some\nibuprofen. We rigged up a few different ways to carry me, using harnesses, slings,\nand carabiners. A large group of people had assembled to help, and it took us about\n1.5 to 2 hours to get back to the cars.\n    Editor\u2019s Note: Ryan was driven to the emergency room in Moab, where he was diag-\nnosed with a dislocated ankle, fractured fibula, and fractured posterior malleolus. He\nhas since recovered nearly fully.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nANALYSIS\nI made several mistakes. The biggest and most impactful was I let myself become\noverconfident, even cocky. I felt good on the climbs I had done the day before and\nthought Vinciny would be within my abilities. This overconfidence played into\ncomplacency when I didn\u2019t seek out a guidebook or Mountain Project for better\ngear beta. The next huge mistake was choosing not to not haul up a 0.75 cam when\nI had the option. For some reason, I got it into my head that pulling up gear would\nmess with the \u201cpurity\u201d of the onsight.\n    To add to the sketchiness of my situation, I was run-out on a purple TCU (the\nsecond-smallest in the range), not ideal for catching a big fall, and also not ideal for\nsandstone. Even if I had decent protection in the flake, there was still potential to\ndeck on the ledge.\n    [Editor\u2019s Note: While skipping a clip on an overhanging sport climb can be exhila-\nrating, punching to the chains, sans gear on soft sandstone, can lead to injury, as Ryan\ncan now attest.]\n    Almost everyone on scene, including myself, had at least a WFR certification. This\nmade evacuating me super smooth. I\u2019m extremely grateful to my many first respond-\ners for making a bad situation as good as could be. For everything that went wrong\nthat day, a lot of things went right. I\u2019m lucky to be alive. (Source: Ryan McAvoy.)",

The rock struck his son, Ian\n(16), who was belaying, breaking the latter\u2019s femur. They called 911 and were rescued\nby helicopter.\n     The team was very expe-\nrienced and chose an objec-\ntive that was big, accessible,\nand near the west entrance\nof the park.

        "Details_Factors": "\nIndex, Inner Walls\nOn the afternoon of July 20, I (male, 29) was climbing at Index with P, who had several\nyears of climbing experience. P could comfortably lead 5.11 sport routes, but had\nlimited experience with trad climbing. I had four years of mountaineering experi-\nence and 1.5 years of trad.\n    Having both warmed up, we moved toward a popular 100-foot trad climb, Toxic\nShock (5.9), that I wanted to lead. I had successfully top-roped the route twice and\nfelt I had a reasonable chance of success.\n    I climbed the first part of the route and reached a large ledge with an obvious\nhorn. I then began the second part, placing two cams in relatively short succession\nto protect against ledge fall. I came to a hand crack and climbed this part as a layback,\nwith my body positioned at an angle. This position (unnoticed by me) put a small ledge\ndirectly in my fall line. Approximately six feet above my last protection, I successfully\nplaced a cam from the layback position. I pulled up rope and attempted to clip, but\nmy feet, positioned in a smear on the protruding edge of the crack, slipped.\n    Due to the angle of my body, I rotated slightly, mainly facing outward as I fell. I\ncontacted the small ledge with my left ribcage. The fall distance to the ledge was\nabout eight to 12 feet. I continued to fall slightly further, and the two cams I had\nplaced earlier held.\n    It was immediately obvious to me that I had broken at least one rib. My climbing\npartner lowered me, and I walked (in pain) to the car and drove myself to the hospital.\nThe ER confirmed three broken ribs, with no other complications.\n ANALYSIS\nThe main reason for this injury is I failed to place protection in a manner consistent\nwith the ledge-fall hazard. My climbing mentors had continually bombarded me with\nwarnings of being vigilant about ledges. As I departed the large ledge, this reminder\nwas loud and clear. However, I failed to observe that I had climbed into a position\nabove a second, smaller ledge.\n   A contributing factor may have been my climbing technique: Better climbers\nmight choose to jam this section instead of laybacking, keeping the body more\ncentered on the crack and making gear placements and clipping more manageable.\n[Editor\u2019s Note: Laybacking is more intuitive than harder-to-learn jamming skills. It is\nprobably the way this climber originally top-roped the route. As he learned, laybacking\ngenerates a pump faster than jamming while often making placing, visually assessing,\nand clipping of gear, much harder.] Another contributing factor is that I was pulling\nup rope to clip when I fell, adding slack in the rope.

His plan was\nto check out the moves in order to decide if he wanted\nto climb the entire route using the autobelay.\n    Routesetting was being done in an adjacent area,\nand the routesetters had used plastic fencing to cordon\noff the area. A vertical PVC pipe, commonly seen in\ngyms, held up the plastic ribbon tape that comprised\nthe fencing.\n    Frohbieter liked the moves and decided to jump\ndown, clip into the autobelay, and do the climb to the\ntop. He jumped and was impaled by the PVC pipe.\n    Frohbieter recalled, \u201cI looked down my right shoul-\nder, and I just saw the ground, so I just kind of dropped\nfrom the wall.

Unfortunately, his accident and\nhorrendous injuries were very much real. While climbing gyms are generally very\nsafe, the unique aspects of our sport make any style or venue for ascent potentially\ndangerous. Situational awareness is beneficial even indoors. Despite his physical and\nfinancial distress, Frohbieter to his credit recognizes \u201cthe risk and the consequence\u201d\nof climbing and has had only good things to say about the gym and its owner.

        "Details_Factors": "\nMt Rainier, Disappointment Cleaver\nOn August 9, Climber 1 (60), Climber 2 (55), and five friends (ages 30 to 40+) from the\nWasatch and Potomac Mountain clubs were attempting the Disappointment Cleaver\nroute on Rainier. At 10,080 feet (Camp Muir), two members elected not to attempt\nthe summit. The remaining five began ascending at 11 p.m. At about the 12,300-foot\nlevel, Climber 1 and Climber 2 reported feeling sick. After a rest break, Climber 2 felt\neven sicker.\n    When checked, Climber 2 was minimally responsive. He was immobile and seemed\nto be drifting in and out of consciousness. After a quick assessment, the climbing\nparty prepared to report the climber\u2019s condition via inReach. At this point, several\nguided parties arrived. The guides performed a more complete assessment and\nradioed the National Park Service. After about 30 minutes, it was decided that two\nWFR-trained guides would stay with the patient (and the climbing team) and wait\nfor additional help to arrive after dawn.\n    In the morning, Climber 2 was transported by helicopter long-line to Camp\nMuir. From there he was helicoptered down to Paradise at 5,400 feet and even-\ntually transferred to the hospital in Puyallup. He had improved rapidly during\nthe helicopter descent and was discharged from the hospital that night without\na conclusive diagnosis. The climbing party\u2019s working assumption was a case of\nacute mountain sickness (AMS), lapsing into high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).\nTheir conclusions were based on the nature of the symptoms and rapid improve-\nment with descent.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe patient had eaten and drunk fluids normally at Camp Muir before the summit\nattempt. He had been to 10,000 feet regularly in the Wasatch Mountains without\nincident but had experienced AMS (though not with this sort of severity) on one\noccasion at 12,000 feet. Climbing Rainier on a typically fast visitor schedule poses\nacclimatization problems, since most trips to the mountain start near sea level. The\nclimbing party stated that it would have been desirable to have experience at 13,000\nto 14,000 feet prior to attempting Mt. Rainier. However, acute mountain sickness,\nhigh altitude pulmonary edema, and HACE can strike even experienced climbers and\neven at relatively low elevations (roughly 2,500 meters or 8,200 feet above sea level).\n(Sources: Climber 1 and the Editors.)",

Stuart spent one week in\nthe ICU with injuries including lacerations to his right arm and kidney, fractures of\nthe thoracic and cervical spine, a subdural hematoma, and five broken ribs.\n\nANALYSIS\nStuart was using a Petzl Shunt with no backup device as a self-belay on a single 9.5mm\ndynamic rope.

The reporting party told the ranger\nthat Climber 1 (27) had taken a leader fall and had an open fracture to the left leg that\nwas bleeding heavily, and the climber was potentially going into shock. The belayer\nwas unable to lower the leader to the ground.\n   Based on subsequent investigation, Climber 1 had started up their second pitch,\nwhich began with an undercling and layback flake just above the belay. Climber 1\nhad placed a single piece of protection before falling. The protection pulled. Neither\nclimber had clipped the lead rope to the anchor as a first piece of protection. Climber\n2, who was belaying off his harness, had difficulty holding the fall. Climber 1 and\nClimber 2 had intermediate developed climbing skills.\n     Helicopter 35HX, with pilot Steve Wilson, flew a recon of the scene and landed\ntwo rangers in Garnet Meadows to start hiking to the base of the climb. The helicop-\nter returned to the Lupine Meadows rescue cache at 11:45 a.m. and was rigged for\nshort-haul. The pilot and spotter determined that a single rescuer could be safely\ninserted into the accident scene.\n    Once at the belay stance, the rescuer provided emergency medical care to stabi-\nlize Climber 1 and splinted the climber\u2019s legs for evacuation. The rescuer and Climber\n1 were extracted by helicopter.\n\nANALYSIS\nOpen Book is a justifiably popular Teton classic. It also has some of the same hazards\none would expect on a multipitch alpine rock climb, including tricky protection. In\nthis case, placing an additional piece might have prevented such a long fall. Also,\nclipping the lead rope through a runner at the belay would have redirected the fall\nand made catching the fall easier. This is a standard practice among experienced trad\nclimbers.

One\nof the climbers called Teton Dispatch and described the predicament to ranger M.\nShain. The climber indicated they were uninjured but would \u201clikely die\u201d if they tried\nto descend the icy rock route in the dark with only one headlamp. The climber also\nstated that neither of them had appropriate clothing to spend the night. With very\nlittle power left on the climber\u2019s cell phone, ranger Shain instructed the climbers to\nfind a site protected from the wind and told them it would be many hours before any\nhelp could reach them. Shortly thereafter, the climber\u2019s phone battery died.\n     At 11 p.m., rangers N. Ronczkowski and C. Heerdt departed from the Lupine Mead-\nows trailhead for the summit of the Grand Teton. They arrived at the NPS Lower\nSaddle camp at 2:15 a.m. on August 31 and added food, water, warm layers, climb-\ning equipment, and crampons to their packs. The rangers continued up the Owen-\nSpalding route, reaching the summit of the Grand at 5 a.m. Shortly thereafter, the\nstranded party was found near the top of the Ford Couloir, to the southwest of the\nsummit. The climbers were uninjured but very weak from their unplanned bivouac.\n     After receiving food, water, and warm clothing, Climbers 1 and 2 were short-roped\n down the upper Owen-Spalding route and assisted down the rappel to the Upper\nSaddle. At 7:25 a.m., ranger Ronczkowski reported that the rescued party was capa-\nble of continuing their descent to the Lower Saddle without any further assistance.\n\nANALYSIS\nLate in the day it is easy to get overextended by the promise of a summit. One also\nhas to account for the rigors of the descent after a long day. This party could have\nmade the choice to descend along Wall Street in the evening after already spending\n12 hours to complete the Lower Exum. Their decision to continue up another 1,000\nvertical feet of easier but still technical terrain led to a cold night on the summit.\nOn any long mountain route, sufficient water, food, extra clothing, and headlamps\nmust be carried to allow either a safe nighttime descent or unplanned bivouac.\n(Sources: Ranger Ken Kreis, Grand Teton National Park, and the Editors.)",

I had to quickly figure it out. I carry a Petzl Micro Traxion as well as a Ster-\nling HollowBlock to use as a prusik. I attached the HollowBlock high and clipped into\nit with my rappel extension. I put the Micro Traxion low on the rope and rigged a foot\nstirrup with a cordelette, all while hanging in air 500 feet above the boulder field.\n     I figured out the method\u2014step up on the Traxion, slide up the prusik, sit back on the\nprusik, pull slack through the Traxion, repeat over and over. A few times, I got to where\nI thought I could climb, but it was too complicated to switch from jugging to climbing.\n     At one point the sling to my prusik got tangled in the Traxion. Somehow I got the\nTraxion opened (while just hanging on the prusik) and freed the sling. It\u2019s impossible\nto relay the genuine fear I had during this experience. In the end it all worked out,\nand in about an hour I was back on top. I learned a lot.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Meadows rappels are known to lead climbers astray and have been the location\nof at least one recorded fatality. The descent is unobvious, despite it being used to\ndescend from the most popular routes on Devils Tower. With an almost 90-year\nrock climbing history, there are many anchors on the Tower\u2013some at five- to ten-\nfoot intervals\u2013that make even well-traveled rappels problematic. As David recounts,\n\u201cI should have spent more time looking around and been 100 percent sure of the\ndescent route. The top of the Tower is disorienting if you don\u2019t pay attention to the\nlandscape on the ground.\u201d\n    David was smart to carry tools for ascending a fixed rope\u2014a little prior practice\nwould have made his journey back to the anchor a lot easier. Learn and practice safe\ntransitions from rappelling to ascending and the methods to back up such an ascent.\nBringing radios was another good choice. David recalls, \u201cIt was very windy, and it was\nimpossible to shout. Without the radios I\u2019m pretty sure I would have had to call SAR.\nBest thirty dollars I ever spent.\u201d (Sources: David, via Mountain Project, and the Editors.)",

At the time, Dalpe was a climber with five\n                                  years of experience. Though he consistently climbed\n                                  5.13 sport routes, his multi-pitch experience was limited\n                                  to two years, mainly on bolted routes around Squamish.\n                                  His partner (female, 29) was a beginner climber using\n                                  borrowed gear. This was her first multi-pitch outing.\n                                      Around 12:30 p.m., the pair started up Born Again,\n                                  a link-up combining sections of established routes\n                                  with new pitches to create \u201cthe best protected 5.10 on\n                                  the Apron.\u201d Its copious protection, bolted belays, and\n                                  generally forgiving angle made it a fine choice given\nRed line shows the first two the team\u2019s limited experience.\npitches of Born Again on Squa-\n                                      To avoid a party climbing above, Dalpe decided to\nmish\u2019s Apron.

The partner carried a traditional belay/rappel\ndevice, though she was not experienced enough to rappel. Dalpe planned to use his\nGrigri to lower her and then make a single-line rappel, using her weight at the oppo-\nsite end of the rope as a counterweight anchor. He untied his partner, threaded the\nrope end through the rappel rings, retied her, and then used his Grigri to lower her\nto a prominent ledge. Once there, she traversed to a tree anchor and connected to\nit with a personal anchor system (PAS). Before lowering her, Dalpe had said to his\npartner, \u201cGo to the tree anchor, clip in, and do nothing.\u201d\n    Dalpe set up his Grigri to rappel and started down the single strand. Halfway to\nthe tree anchor, the rope became suddenly unweighted and Dalpe tumbled down\nthe rock. While he was falling, the rope through Dalpe\u2019s Grigri went slack and, \u201cI saw\nthe rope swirling orange and I kept asking, \u2018When am I gonna stop?\u2019 \u201d\n    Dalpe hit the ground, rolled a distance, and came to rest at a tree. Climbers\napproaching the cliff rushed up to help. One called for an ambulance at 1:45 p.m.\nAnother team that was on Born Again rappelled to Dalpe\u2019s partner and lowered her\nto the ground. At 3:45 p.m., Dalpe was transported by ambulance to the hospital.\n    He escaped with relatively minor injuries considering his 200-foot tumble. (He\n was not wearing a helmet.) He suffered a broken sternum, two broken bones in the\nright foot, plus multiple abrasions to his scapula and back of his head. He spent one\nmonth on a couch, and four months later he was climbing 5.13 again. (Sources: Inter-\nview with Danny Dalpe and report from British Columbia Emergency Health Services.)\n\nANALYSIS\nIt appears the rappel failed when Dalpe\u2019s partner somehow managed to untie her knot\nas he rappelled the single strand. Her half-tied figure 8 was discovered to be cinched\ntight. It had pulled through the rappel rings\u2014no doubt slowing Dalpe as he tumbled\ntoward the ground. It seems likely she began to untie as soon as she clipped into the\nanchor, and that some element of the system temporarily held Dalpe\u2019s weight until\nhe had already committed to the rappel.\n    Counterweight systems\u2014simul-rappelling, counter-ascending, or the descent\nmethod chosen by Dalpe in this incident\u2014are for experts only. In fact, accidents\ninvolving such systems have claimed even very experienced climbers. The entire\nteam needs to understand the necessity and process of maintaining a closed system\nuntil both parties are on the ground or securely anchored. Given his partner\u2019s limited\nexperience, Dalpe could have made better choices involving the route, equipment,\nand rappel method.\n    The transition from single-pitch sport to multi-pitch routes\u2014even on a mostly\nbolted climb with solid chain anchors\u2014presents many challenges. First was equip-\nment. This pair was equipped with a single rope and only one traditional rappel\ndevice, which necessitated a complex counterweighted rappel when they decided\nto bail. Another issue was experience. Dalpe\u2019s partner, through no fault of her own,\nwas clearly in over her head.\n    Dalpe\u2019s physical climbing ability might have contributed indirectly to the accident.\nClimbing 5.13 after only a few years is an empowering\u2014and often misleading\u2014expe-\nrience. In a multi-pitch or trad environment, a metric like a sport climbing grade is\nan inadequate substitute for proper tools, training, and experience. To his credit,\nDalpe chose to descend when he recognized they were over their head on this long\nroute. It takes years of practice to develop the skills and judgment to safely lead an\ninexperienced partner up a multi-pitch climb. (Source: The Editors.)",

Then we put on a\ntourniquet. We had no cell service and hadn\u2019t brought a satellite phone on our \u201ccasual\u201d\nday of bouldering. We\u2019d also scrambled up a lot of loose talus, so getting a piggyback\nfrom Steve seemed dangerous. It was close to 6:30 p.m., and we decided the best\naction was for Steve to run to his vehicle and get a cell signal. We\u2019d both driven, and\nhis car was parked below, near my van.\n    Almost a year prior, a friend had severed his finger and we had called SAR to get\nhim to a hospital to get it reattached, but it took several hours for the helicopter to\narrive. With that in mind and it being close to dark, I wasn\u2019t excited to wait around.\nI waited five minutes (which felt like hours) and started crawling down the talus to\nmy van. For the most part it went fine, switching between scooting on my butt and\ndownclimbing using my knees and good foot. My bad foot would flop uncontrollably\nand the bone would move in and out of place.\n    At one point I had to overcome an oven-size boulder. Just as I was getting to\nthe bottom, the whole thing started to shift. I got out of the way, but in my haste, I\ntouched my bloody stump on the ground. I sat there for five minutes, feeling lucky I\nwasn\u2019t pinned, but also looking at all the dirt I had accumulated on my wound. I was\nmindful that I was probably in shock and could pass out at any moment. I continued\n to push on. After about 45 minutes or an hour, I made it back to my van.\n    Steve had gone to call for help, and there was no way to communicate as I still\ndidn\u2019t have a cell signal. My brain was in full survival mode. Nothing could stop\nme from getting to the hospital. I started driving. (Thankfully my van is an auto-\nmatic.) I drove for 15 to 20 minutes toward town when I saw an ambulance driving\ntoward me. I pulled over and waved them down. They were surprised, to say the\nleast, that I was driving in my condition. Steve drove up a little after I waved down\nthe ambulance.\n    In the hospital I found out that, when my foot impacted the ground, my talus bone\ndislocated from my calcaneus and snapped two tendons, an artery, blood vessels,\nnerves, and most of the ligaments on the inside of my ankle. I had two surgeries in\nseven days.\n\nANALYSIS\nFast-forward ten months and I have 80 percent mobility back. I\u2019m climbing and work-\ning and very optimistic for a full recovery.\n    Thinking back, I believe Steve and I made the right decision to get me to the\nhospital as quickly as possible. The doctor later told me that the sooner they can\noperate, the better their chances for saving a foot after an accident like mine. But I\ndon\u2019t think they would promote \u201chiking\u201d or driving in that condition. I also knew that\na tourniquet could cause serious complications, but I wanted to keep the blood flow\nto a minimum so I opted to keep it on.\n    I also think bouldering can be more dangerous than most people think. I fell maybe\n15 feet and missed my pads by a foot or less. What would I do in the future? Bring\nmore pads and scope the top-out before going for anything that\u2019s too tall for a fall.\n(Source: Drew Leiterman.)",

It cammed well, but\nthe crack was full of small surface crystals, and the rock appeared unstable on one side.\nI continued climbing five feet above the cam and pulled on a juggy hold. I fully trusted\nthe jug without checking it, and it pulled off the wall. I took a ground fall from 12 feet\nup, landed on my back, and flipped over and down another three feet.

There were obvious\nscars in the crack where the cam lobes had crushed the small surface crystals. The\ncam itself was intact. Though I recognized the placement was poor, I had not expected\nto fall on this easy pitch and placed the cam mostly for practice. In hindsight, there\nwas a tree that could have been clipped three feet lower as a good first piece.\n    Given the established nature of the route, I also did not anticipate a hold would\nbreak so easily, and I should have tested the holds before trusting them. My helmet\nwas very damaged and softened the impact but came off in the fall. The buckle was\nfine, but the chinstrap likely should have been tighter. As beginning trad climbers,\nboth of us feel that, in the future, a bomber first piece of pro should be placed.

Parks Canada\n\n    Around 7:45 a.m. the climbers were caught in an avalanche. Peter Tucker, execu-\ntive director of the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides, said in a press release\nthat it cannot be determined whether the climbers were caught in the path of an\navalanche that started far above them or if they somehow triggered it. He added\nthat the slide \u201cwasn\u2019t survivable\u201d and that \u201cthey were carried down a slope a very\nlong way.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Parks Canada further reported on the Mountain Information Network that the\navalanche was \u201cdirectly observed and reported immediately. Initial speculation is that\nthe pair triggered the slide and were climbing, short-roped together.\u201d The report said\nthe avalanche was a size 2.5, 60 meters (196 feet) wide, 75 centimeters (30 inches)\ndeep, and ran for 900 meters (3,000 feet). Specific conditions data for the day were\nunavailable, but conditions were such that a number of other teams were climbing\non Andromeda and neighboring Athabasca at the time of the avalanche.\n\nANALYSIS\nSkyladder is a popular alpine outing that presents an attractive profile from the Trans-\nCanada Highway.

Unable to find the best route\nthrough the exposed terrain, the climber attempted to retreat down the south-\nwest slope of the mountain to the valley. While retreating, the climber encountered\nseveral cliff bands they were unable to navigate.

For much of\nits 12-mile length, the ridge involves poor rock quality and exposed, complex terrain.\nThe average time to complete the route is between 11 and 16 hours. By October in\nthe Canadian Rockies, the sun sets around 7 p.m. These shorter days provide less\ndaylight to complete an objective of this length, and the limited daylight also plays a\nfactor in the ability to carry out a rescue.\n     Along the ridge are many opportunities to retreat down the southwest slopes of\nRundle. However, there are many places that appear suitable to descend, yet retreat\nactually is not possible. Preplanning exit spots along the ridge helps to ensure a\nsuccessful escape if needed.\n     The climber selected a good weather window, and the route was in good condition,\nfree of snow and ice. They were carrying an appropriate communication device and\nwere able to call for help, which allowed for a successful rescue. (Source: Parks Canada.)",

Rundle\nOn July 10, a party of two was climbing Generosity (13 pitches, 5.9), a long, mixed-\nprotection route near Canmore. On pitch seven, the leader pulled off a loose rock,\nwhich caused him to fall 30 to 40 feet.

        "Details_Factors": "LARGE GROUP CAUGHT IN SLIDE\nWashington, Silver Basin (Crystal Mountain)\nOn the morning of Saturday, December 11, the first major winter storm of the season\nwas impacting the Cascades. Until this point, thin snow cover had limited back-\ncountry recreation opportunities. A group of six ski tourers decided to travel in the\nSilver Basin area of Crystal Mountain ski resort due to its generally good early season\ncoverage and easy access. Weather stations at the ski area recorded 11 inches of new\nsnow on Friday night, with an additional five inches falling on Saturday. Wind speeds\naveraged 40\u201350 mph, with a gust up to 90 mph recorded during the storm. The Silver\nBasin area of the resort was not yet open, and ski patrol had not conducted any\navalanche mitigation work for the season. As a result, the basin contained a \u201cback-\ncountry\u201d snowpack.\n    The group left the parking lot and ascended the approved uphill travel route\nthrough a section of the open ski resort. As they neared Silver Basin, the group broke\ntrail, staying within the ski area boundary. Members of the team noted the stormy\nweather, including continued snowfall and blowing snow. While the group may have\nnoticed these possible signs of unstable snow, they did not discuss them during a\nshort break near the bottom of the basin. Instead, they decided to continue ascend-\ning toward a prominent low point in the ridgeline called Silver Saddle.\n    The party traveled close together as they continued to break trail across a long\nascending traverse. About 250 feet shy of the saddle, members of the team reported\nseeing cracking and felt \u201cthe snow change.\u201d They immediately switchbacked, hoping\nto find a location near some rocks to transition for the ski down. It was at this moment\n that the slope released. All members of the group were immediately caught in the\nmoving torrent of snow. The avalanche failed about 200 feet above their heads, was\nnearly 600 feet wide, and ran 650 vertical feet.\n    Three members of the team were carried 250 feet downhill and deposited close\ntogether. Skiers 1 and 3 were only partially buried and able to quickly free themselves.\nSkier 3 immediately called 911 and was patched through to Crystal Mountain ski patrol.\nSkier 2 was located, fully buried, and was found not breathing but with a pulse. After\nthe other skiers cleared his airway and rolled Skier 2 on his side, he began to breathe.\n    The other three members of the team were carried further down the slope, past\na small treed knoll, and deposited in a scattered group. Even though he traveled to\nnear the toe of the debris, Skier 6 was mostly on the surface and was able to begin\nsearching for his teammates. He rapidly located and uncovered Skier 5. A nearby\nparty that witnessed the event also responded. Witness 1 quickly located Skier 4\nwith his beacon and probe. Skier 4 had been carried through a stand of small trees,\nover a short cliff, and was buried under about a foot of debris. Witness 1 immediately\nnoticed obvious signs of trauma. After clearing the airway, he began performing CPR.\nUnfortunately, Skier 4 did not respond to any of these interventions. Eventually all\nmembers of the party decided to retreat to a safer location due to the ongoing storm.\nSki patrol and other rescuers responded to the scene and assisted the remainder of\nparty back to the trailhead.\n\nANALYSIS\nAccidents like this provide several learning outcomes. Much of this information\nwas collected through post-accident interviews between involved parties and the\nNorthwest Avalanche Center. We appreciate these individuals sharing their story so\nothers can learn from this tragedy.\n    While all members of the party reportedly checked the avalanche forecast for\nSaturday, the selection of Silver Basin was based on coverage and early season\nski quality instead of potential avalanche conditions. This factor may have been\ncompounded by lack of familiarity with the terrain. Many members of the team had\nbeen to the area, but only once or twice. Only one individual had significant expe-\nrience traveling in Silver Basin. This resulted in that person becoming the de facto\nleader. While not their intent, having only one member of the group familiar with\nthe terrain significantly changed the team\u2019s decision-making process. As mentioned\nabove, several individuals noticed the ongoing storm and possible signs of unstable\nsnow, but they continued onward despite these concerns. While ascending toward the saddle, and well within the start zone of the avalanche\npath, the group was traveling very close together. This travel technique may have\nbetter enabled communication among the large team, especially in the stormy\nweather, but it also exposed all members to the hazard simultaneously. As a result,\nall six teammates were caught and carried in the avalanche. It is only by a matter of\nluck that at least some of the group remained on the surface, uninjured and able to\nassist in the rescue.\n    One bright spot in these events was the quick and effective rescue of two fully\nburied teammates. This emphasizes the potential for well-practiced and executed\navalanche rescue to save lives. The team and responding witnesses should be\ncommended for these quick actions. It also highlights the impact of terrain traps on\nfatal outcomes. While all members of the group were caught and carried, the sole\nfatality was a result of traumatic injuries inflicted by traveling through trees and over\nrocks.

On\nMarch 17, 2022, five of the members skied a couple of low-angle runs and some trees\non nearby Mt. Wow (10,262 feet), with no signs of instability except for one collapse\nor whumpf on low-angle terrain.\n    In midafternoon, one of the more experienced group members led the party toward\na north-facing slope (Danford\u2019s Bowl) dropping toward Game Creek. The intent was to\nski in pitches to reach a bench above a terrain funnel and then exit skier\u2019s left to skin\nback toward the yurt. The first skier planned to descend near trees on the skier\u2019s right\nside of the bowl, and warned the others to stay to the right of two tracks laid by skiers\none hour earlier. He skied the pitch to a safe zone near the trees, and the rest of the\nparty skied the pitch one at at time and gathered below dense trees.\n    Skier 1 left the safe zone first. He stopped just above the team\u2019s planned exit on\nskier\u2019s left and directly in the avalanche path. Skier 2 continued past Skier 1 and\nonto the bench. Skier 3 then stopped near Skier 1 and sat down in the snow. Finally,\nSkier 4 dropped in and rode close to the left boundary made by the previous pair of\ntracks. As he skied by the leader of the first pitch, still watching from the trees, the\nslope released. Skier 4 turned safely out of the path, but Skiers 1 and 3 were carried\ndownslope into the narrow confines of the exit gully and out into the fan of debris,\nfor a total vertical distance of 525 feet.\n    After identifying the point where the two skiers were last seen, the remaining\nskiers switched their avalanche beacons to search and side-slipped into the tight\ngully below.

As Skier 4 continued following the other beacon signal, the\nremaining skiers began to dig out the buried victim. They soon reached Skier 3\u2019s\nface, which had a bluish tinge from early cyanosis. After receiving rescue breaths,\nthe buried Skier 3 regained respiratory drive.\n    Meanwhile, a little higher in the debris, Skier 4 pinpointed Skier 1, who was\ndetected 0.8 meters beneath the surface, and began to dig.

While traveling, the group separated into\nGroup A and Group B, planning to ski different routes and then regroup below Silver\nFork\u2019s West Bowl. Group A consisted of four clients and one guide, moving at a bit\nfaster pace, while Group B consisted of two clients and one guide.\n    After climbing to the rim of East Bowl, Group A ascended to East Peak, safely\ndescended the northwest ridge and East Bowl, and then waited for Group B on a\nbench above a gully at the base of West Bowl. Group B arrived at East Bowl Pass and\nheaded up Davenport Hill to ski Cabin Ridgeline northward into Silver Fork, where\nthey would meet the skiers of Group A.\n    Group B descended Cabin Ridgeline one at a time in pitches. On the final ski pitch\nto join Group A, the first skier safely descended. While the second skier was midway\ndown the pitch, an avalanche released above them. The party below yelled \u201cAvalanche!\u201d\nand the skier was able to head off the slope and away from the slide. However, the guide\nat the top of the pitch was caught, carried, and fully buried down in the gully below.\n    At approximately 12:30 p.m., one of the party members called 911 and the group\nquickly booted toward the debris pile. After a beacon search and positive probe strike\ndeep under the surface, the skiers dug furiously, extracted the patient, and cleared\nhis airway. It took 23 minutes from the time the avalanche was initially triggered to\nthe time the skier\u2019s airway was cleared.\n    The skier was breathing and had a pulse when the airway was cleared. Having been\nstrained through trees in the avalanche, he experienced trauma on his face and torso\n[six broken ribs, a bruised lung, and facial lacerations, according to a published report].\n    Five minutes after the buried skier was recovered, Solitude ski patrol arrived on\nthe scene. The skier was hoisted out by Lifeflight around 2:30 p.m.; he was in critical\nbut stable condition. The remaining party members skied out with Solitude ski patrol.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Utah Avalanche Center had issued a Special Avalanche Bulletin for the day of the\naccident. The forecast avalanche hazard was Considerable on north to east aspects\nat all elevations, following a week of stormy weather that buried a weak layer of\nfaceted snow formed during a period of drought in January and February. Clearing\nskies and a sunny weekend lured many skiers out despite the hazard. The avalanche\ncenter\u2019s bulletin for March 12 warned, \u201cDangerous avalanche conditions combined\n\n\n112 / ACCIDENTS 2022\n with great powder and\nbeautiful weather make\naccidents likely.

In a personal\naccount of the accident included with the Utah Avalanche Center report, Passey\nreported that the whole party had discussed the avalanche hazard and performed\nbeacon checks before the tour, and during the initial ascent they dug three pits to\nassess conditions. Passey also said she carefully checked slope angles all day using a\nshaded Cal Topo map, in order to stay away from steeper terrain.\n    In an interview in Outside, Benegas attributed the accident to overconfidence,\nestimating he had skied this same slope 150 times without incident. \u201cIt has been an\nextremely difficult year,\u201d Benegas told Outside. \u201cOur snowpack has been challenging\nto forecast on the micro-terrain assessment aspect.\u201d\n    The Utah Avalanche Center report said a couple of things went right for [Benegas]\nthat could have very easily gone wrong:\n\u2022   The skier lived despite being buried for 23 minutes under nearly two meters of\n    snow. [The first probe strike was at 1.5 meters, but Benegas was facing diago-\n    nally downhill; the rescuers first uncovered his boot and pack and had to dig\n    extensively to reach his face and clear his airway.] Below the 15-minute mark\n    in a burial, the probability of survival drops rapidly. At the 23-minute mark, the\n    probability drops to 35 percent.\n\u2022   A skilled team was close by. Since [Benegas] was the last in his group at the top of\n    the pitch, and Group A was already at the bottom of the slope, in most situations\n    like this the rescuers would have had to transition back to uphill ski mode to reach\n    the burial site. In this case, they were able to reach the site on foot, saving them\n    valuable time. As well, the two clients with Group B had less avalanche training\n    than the members of Group A. The close location of Group A allowed the more\n    experienced members to run the rescue.\n\u2022   This easily could have been a multi-burial situation. At the time of the avalanche,\n    two skiers were within the path.

Peck\nOn March 10, 2022, two backcountry riders set out for an outing near Mt. Peck (12,208\nfeet), about 1.5 miles southeast of Monarch Pass. Rider 1 traveled on skis and Rider 2\non a snowboard. They brought their dog along for the tour. The plan was to ascend\nthe northwest ridge of Mt. Peck to near the summit and possibly descend lower-angle\nterrain along the northeast ridge into the North Fooses Creek drainage.\n    During their ascent, they decided instead to descend a steep northeast-facing\nslope before reaching the summit. Rider 1 skied a short distance down in forested\nterrain on the skier\u2019s right side of the slope. Rider 2 then descended a short distance\npast Rider 1, still staying in the trees. They commented on the lack of a slab and no\ncracking or collapsing, and decided to finish their descent further skier\u2019s left, down\nsteeper and more open terrain. They identified a point to meet in low-angle terrain\nabout 500 feet downslope from the steeper headwall. Rider 2 descended first and\nstopped at the regroup point without incident. Rider 1 then sent the dog down, who\nreached Rider 2 safely.\n    As Rider 1 began his descent, he triggered an avalanche on his second turn. He was\nimmediately swept off his feet and deployed his airbag. He was carried around 400\nvertical feet before ending up against a tree, lying on his side with avalanche debris\ncovering his face. He was able to free an arm and clear his face after \u201can eternity of\nseconds.\u201d He had lost one ski.\n    Rider 2 described the collapse of the slope as severe enough to knock her\nover while standing with her feet strapped into her snowboard. She could see the\navalanche coming, but did not have time to deploy her airbag. The avalanche washed\nover her and the dog, carrying her down the slope. When the avalanche stopped,\nshe was face down and covered by less than a foot of snow. A portion of her helmet\nand snowboard were visible on the surface. She had been buried with one hand very\nclose to her face, and she was able to pull off her glove with her teeth and move her\nfingers enough to clear snow from her face. She started yelling for Rider 1, who quickly\nlocated and extricated her.\n    The riders began looking for their dog, but there were no visible clues or tracks\nin the area. They probed the debris for approximately an hour, but did not locate the\ndog. They made the difficult decision to leave the scene and head back to the trail-\nhead, strapping a shovel to Rider 1\u2019s foot so he could make his way out with just one ski.\n    Two days after the accident, motorists came upon the dog near the top of Monarch\nPass. He was reunited with the owners.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe avalanche occurred on a very steep (40\u00b0) north-facing slope near treeline. It was\na hard slab avalanche, medium-size relative to the path. The avalanche broke three\nto five feet deep on a layer of faceted crystals that were first buried by a storm on\nFebruary 21. As the avalanche ran, it gouged down into snow layers near the ground\nin the steepest and rockiest areas of the path.\n    The Colorado Avalanche Information Center\u2019s (CAIC) forecast for the Sawatch\nzone on the day of the avalanche was Considerable (Level 3) danger near and above\n\n\n114 / ACCIDENTS 2022\n   DOGS IN AVALANCHE TERRAIN\n  During the 2021-22 season, in Colo-\n  rado alone, three dogs were killed in\n  avalanche incidents along with human\n  companions. In other cases, dogs\u2014\n  and their owners\u2014narrowly escaped\n  avalanches. In one incident at the\n  popular Berthoud Pass riding zone,\n  on December 26, 2021, a dog triggered\n  an avalanche that swept it about 300\n  yards to the bottom of a chute and\n  buried the animal. The owner and\n  witnesses initially used their trans-\n                                            Apollo triggered an avalanche above Berthoud\n  ceivers to search for potentially buried\n                                            Pass, Colorado, and was buried but recovered.\n  people, and then, finding nothing, Colorado Avalanche Information Center\n  they probed for 15 to 20 minutes until,\n  happily, one of them found the dog alive and unharmed.\n      Many dogs love snow, and winter travel with a pet can be a joyful experience.\n  But dogs that aren\u2019t trained for avalanche duty can easily run into a hazardous\n  area, and animal companions add complexity to decision-making and a signifi-\n  cant element of uncertainty in avalanche terrain. (The slide triggered by the\n  dog at Berthoud Pass had the potential to bury any skier below, and the search\n  for the buried pooch exposed several people to additional risk.) If you choose to\n  travel in avalanche terrain with a dog, the animal should be highly responsive to\n  voice commands. Terrain choices should be more conservative than usual. And\n  dogs should never be outfitted with an avalanche beacon. We love our pets, but\n  a signal from a pet\u2019s beacon could cause a life-threatening delay to the search\n  for possible buried people. \u2014The Editors\n\n\n\ntreeline and Moderate (Level 2) below treeline.

        "Details_Factors": "Familiarity Heuristic\nColorado, Park Range, North Fork of Fish Creek\nOn March 19, 2022, two backcountry skiers planned a trip to an area locally known\nas the Dome in the North Fork of Fish Creek, about eight miles east of the town of\nSteamboat Springs. Skier 1 arrived at the Dry Lake trailhead around 8:30 a.m. While\nhe waited for Skier 2, he read the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC)\nforecast and noted that it listed a persistent slab avalanche problem in all elevation\nbands on northwest, north, northeast, and east-facing aspects. He then made a quick\nski run on a low-angle, west-facing slope near the parking lot. He felt the snow was\nstable in this area.\n    When Skier 2 arrived, the two unloaded snowmobiles and rode east up County\nRoad 38 for about 11 miles to Buffalo Pass, then continued toward the Dome and\nparked their snowmobiles. Skier 2 had been in the area many times and took the lead\nas they skinned across three small knobs to reach the spot where Skier 2 planned to\ndescend into the North Fork of Fish Creek.\n    Starting first, Skier 2 descended 100 to 200 vertical feet on a treed slope and\nwaited for Skier 1. They did not see any cracking in the snow or hear any whumpfing.\nThe two traversed eastward until they were above a steeper, sparsely treed part of\nthe slope. During the traverse, Skier 1 pushed with his downhill ski to see if he \u201ccould\nget snow to move.\u201d He saw no indications of unstable snow.\n    Skier 2 headed down into the steeper, more open area while Skier 1 waited. After\nSkier 2 made one turn, the whole slope dropped, making a large whumpf. Cracks shot\nout around Skier 2 as the avalanche broke two to three feet above him. The moving\nsnow swept him down the hill and out of sight.\n    Skier 1 turned his transceiver to receive before the avalanche came to a stop.\nHe could see rocks in the spot where Skier 2 triggered the slide, and he picked\nhis way down through them and over a rollover until he could see Skier 2 pinned\nagainst a tree with his back facing uphill. Snow had piled up behind him, and he\nwas not moving.\n    After clearing snow out of Skier 2\u2019s mouth, Skier 1 gave him rescue breaths, but\nthe patient did not respond. Skier 1 called 911, cleared the avalanche debris from Skier\n2\u2019s back to create a flat spot, and began CPR, which he continued for about an hour\nwithout success. Routt County Search and Rescue and Classic Air Medical responded,\nand Skier 1 was evacuated by air. Skier 2\u2019s body was recovered the following day.\n\n\n116 / ACCIDENTS 2022\n ANALYSIS\nThis was a soft slab avalanche, small\nrelative to the size of the path, that\nreleased on a 40\u00b0 northwest-facing\nslope. The avalanche broke on a\npersistent weak layer of faceted\ncrystals buried 18 to 28 inches deep,\nin the middle of the snowpack. Snow\nlayers this weak are not common in\nthe Park Range, and it is especially\nunusual to see a layer this weak\u2014\nthis deep in the snowpack\u2014and still\nreactive in mid-March. However,\nthe danger posed by this layer was Aerial image of avalanche start zone in the North Fork of\n                                       Fish Creek, Colorado.

We will never know his decision-making\nprocess on the day of the accident. However, people\u2019s tendency to rely on familiar\nplaces and situations to help them make decisions is well documented (Herbert, 2010).\nWhen we are accustomed to behaving in a certain way in a certain area, it can be very\ndifficult to recognize unusual conditions and change our approach.\n    Modern avalanche safety courses teach a trip-planning process that includes using\nthe avalanche forecast to determine the type of terrain you want to avoid, then review-\ning your route to ensure it keeps you away from the dangerous areas. On the day of the\naccident, the two skiers did not discuss the avalanche forecast or the details of their\nplan before departing the trailhead. Skier 1 knew the forecast warned of persistent slab\navalanches on northerly slopes; however, although he knew the general destination\nfor the day, he did not know the terrain well enough to match it with the information\nin the forecast and decide in advance if their route was appropriate.\n    Persistent slab avalanches are difficult to predict and are especially dangerous\nwhen they do not provide the feedback we expect, like cracking and collapsing in\nthe snow. The best strategy during these periods is to use the avalanche forecast\nto identify terrain features where this type of avalanche is possible and avoid them.\n(Source: Colorado Avalanche Information Center.)\n\n\nTRIGGERED AVALANCHE CATCHES TWO PARTIES\nNew Hampshire, Mt. Washington, Tuckerman Ravine\nOn December 5, 2021, winds were light in Tuckerman Ravine and temperatures\nseasonably cold, with poor visibility near the top of the ravine. During the five days\nprior, one to three inches of new snow was recorded on Mt. Washington\u2019s summit\neach day, with varying wind from the west and northwest.\n\n\n                                                           Backcount ry Avalanch es / 117\n     Several parties were climbing or skiing in the ravine on December 5. In late morn-\ning, two skiers climbed to the top of Left Gully, evaluating the snowpack along the\nway using hand-shear tests. They found softer snow than expected but no obvious\nsigns of instability. Near the top, where the gully opens up, they noted a shallow pillow\nof wind-drifted snow (maximum of six inches deep) to the right, and they moved up\nleft to avoid the hazard. They transitioned to skis at the top with poor visibility. Both\nwere prepared with avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes.\n    Below them, a solo skier reached his high point, approximately halfway up\nthe gully, and began to transition for skiing, unaware of the two skiers above. His\navalanche beacon had been turned on well before he entered avalanche terrain.\n    The two skiers above made a plan to ski the steeper entry on the right, appro-\npriately skiing one at a time. When the first skier descended, a soft slab released,\npulling the skier off his feet. He was swept down with the debris, and when he and\ndebris reached the constricted portion of the gully, a larger, deeper avalanche was\ntriggered, with a crown line that ran wall to wall, approximately 20 to 26 inches\nat the highest point. This skier was carried approximately 800 vertical feet by the\navalanche, coming to a stop at the entrance of the gully. He was unhurt and on top\nof the snow.\n    The solo skier had not yet removed his crampons when he was caught by the same\navalanche and carried approximately 450 vertical feet, encountering rocks along the\nway and arriving at a point further downhill than the first skier. He was on top of the\nsnow with serious injuries requiring immediate medical attention.\n    The remaining skier descended on skis with continued poor visibility, looking\nfor clues to help find potential victims. He quickly found his partner (the first skier)\nand the injured solo skier. A beacon search of the debris was conducted to rule out\nadditional buried victims. The two uninjured skiers aided the solo skier until addi-\ntional help arrived. The patient was packaged in a rescue litter, and a team consisting\nof USFS snow rangers, the Harvard Cabin caretaker, the two uninjured skiers, and\nseveral kind bystanders spent the next four hours carrying and dragging the patient\nlitter to an ambulance waiting at the trailhead, arriving at approximately 5:30 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nANALYSIS\nAnytime there is new snow and wind, you are likely to find slabs of drifted snow\nwith the potential to avalanche when an additional load such as a skier or climber\nis added. This can and does occur before the Mount Washington Avalanche Center\nbegins issuing a daily avalanche forecast with a hazard rating.\n    In early season, when terrain options for skiing are limited, certain features may\nconcentrate skiers. Left Gully had been a very popular destination over the previous\nfew weeks, with snow coverage top to bottom. This gully is long, with no options to\nescape until the bottom opens up. With poor visibility, it may be impossible to see\nif anyone is above or below, adding an additional hazard. Early season excitement,\nlimited terrain to ski, a shallow snowpack with rock-filled runouts, poor visibility, and\nrecent wind-drifted snow are all factors that contributed to this unfortunate event.\u00a0\u00a0\n    It\u2019s worth remembering that winter is long with (hopefully) plenty of snow to ski.\nSlow down, think carefully about decisions you make, and consider that your actions\nmay also impact others.
